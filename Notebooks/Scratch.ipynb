       " ' Welcome to the first debate night of the 2016 presidential campaign, live from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.\\n\\nI\\'m Megyn Kelly... [applause]... along with my co-moderators, Brett Baier and Chris Wallace.\\n\\nTonight... [applause] Nice.\\n\\nTonight, thousands of people here in the Q, along with millions of voters at home will get their very first chance to see the candidates face off in a debate, answering the questions you want answered.\\n\\nBAIER: Less than a year from now, in this very arena, one of these 10 candidates or one of the seven on the previous debate tonight will accept the Republican party\\'s nomination. [applause]\\n\\nTonight\\'s candidates were selected based on an average of five national polls. Just a few hours ago, you heard from the candidates ranked 11th through 17. And now, the prime-time event, the top 10.\\n\\nWALLACE: Also of note, Fox News is partnering for tonight\\'s debate with Facebook. For the past several weeks, we\\'ve been asking you for questions for the candidates on Facebook. Nearly 6 million of you, 6 million, viewed the debate videos on our site, and more than 40,000 of you submitted questions: some of which you will hear us asking the candidates tonight.\\n\\nKELLY: As for the candidates who will be answering those questions? Here they are.\\n\\nPositioned on the stage by how they stand in the polls, in the center of the stage tonight, businessman Donald Trump. [applause]\\n\\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush. [applause]\\n\\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker. [applause]\\n\\nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. [applause]\\n\\nBAIER: Neurosurgeon, Dr. Ben Carson. [applause]\\n\\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz. [applause]\\n\\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio. [applause]\\n\\nWALLACE: Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. [applause]\\n\\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie. [applause] And your very own governor of Ohio... [applause] ... John Kasich. [applause]\\n\\nWALLACE: Brett -- Brett, I think you would call that a home field advantage.\\n\\nBAIER: It might be. It might be. We\\'ll see.\\n\\n[UNKNOWN]: Is this in the rules? An objection\\'s coming.\\n\\nBAIER: It might be. The rules for tonight are simple. One minute for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups. And if a candidate runs over, you\\'ll hear this.\\n\\nPleasant, no?\\n\\nWe also have a big crowd here with us tonight in the home of the Cavaliers, as I mentioned.\\n\\nAnd while we expect them... [applause] ... we expect them to be enthusiastic, as you heard, we don\\'t want to take anything away from the valuable time for the candidate. So, we\\'re looking for somewhere between a reaction to a LeBron James dunk and the Cleveland Public Library across the street. [laughter] Somewhere there, we\\'ll find a balance tonight.\\n\\nWithout further ado, let\\'s begin.\\n\\nBAIER: Gentlemen, we know how much you love hand-raising questions. So we promise, this is the only one tonight: the only one. Is there anyone on stage, and can I see hands, who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person.\\n\\nAgain, we\\'re looking for you to raise your hand now -- raise your hand now if you won\\'t make that pledge tonight.\\n\\nMr. Trump. [booing] Mr. Trump to be clear, you\\'re standing on a Republican primary debate stage.\\n\\nTRUMP: I fully understand.\\n\\nBAIER: The place where the RNC will give the nominee the nod.\\n\\nTRUMP: I fully understand.\\n\\nBAIER: And that experts say an independent run would almost certainly hand the race over to Democrats and likely another Clinton.\\n\\nYou can\\'t say tonight that you can make that pledge?\\n\\nTRUMP: I cannot say. I have to respect the person that, if it\\'s not me, the person that wins, if I do win, and I\\'m leading by quite a bit, that\\'s what I want to do. I can totally make that pledge. If I\\'m the nominee, I will pledge I will not run as an independent. But -- and I am discussing it with everybody, but I\\'m, you know, talking about a lot of leverage. We want to win, and we will win. But I want to win as the Republican. I want to run as the Republican nominee.\\n\\nBAIER: So tonight, you can\\'t say if another one of these...\\n\\nPAUL: This is what\\'s wrong!\\n\\nBAIER: OK.\\n\\nPAUL: I mean, this is what\\'s wrong. He buys and sells politicians of all stripes, he\\'s already...\\n\\nBAIER: Dr. Paul.\\n\\nPAUL: Hey, look, look! He\\'s already hedging his bet on the Clintons, OK? So if he doesn\\'t run as a Republican, maybe he supports Clinton, or maybe he runs as an independent...\\n\\nBAIER: OK.\\n\\nPAUL: ...but I\\'d say that he\\'s already hedging his bets because he\\'s used to buying politicians.\\n\\nTRUMP: Well, I\\'ve given him plenty of money.\\n\\nBAIER: Just to be clear, you can\\'t make a -- we\\'re gonna -- we\\'re going to move on.\\n\\nYou\\'re not gonna make the pledge tonight?\\n\\nTRUMP: I will not make the pledge at this time.\\n\\nBAIER: OK. Alright. [laughter and boing]\\n\\nKELLY: Gentlemen, our first round of questions is on the subject of electability in the general election, and we start tonight with you, Dr. Carson.\\n\\nYou are a successful neurosurgeon, but you admit that you have had to study up on foreign policy, saying there\\'s a lot to learn.\\n\\nYour critics say that your inexperience shows. You\\'ve suggested that the Baltic States are not a part of NATO, just months ago you were unfamiliar with the major political parties and government in Israel, and domestically, you thought Alan Greenspan had been treasury secretary instead of federal reserve chair.\\n\\nAren\\'t these basic mistakes, and don\\'t they raise legitimate questions about whether you are ready to be president?\\n\\nCARSON: Well, I could take issue with -- with all of those things, but we don\\'t have time.\\n\\nBut I will say, we have a debate here tonight, and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas, and I\\'m looking very much forward to demonstrating that, in fact, the thing that is probably most important is having a brain, and to be able to figure things out and learn things very rapidly.\\n\\nSo, you know, experience comes from a large number of different arenas, and America became a great nation early on not because it was flooded with politicians, but because it was flooded with people who understood the value of personal responsibility, hard work, creativity, innovation, and that\\'s what will get us on the right track now, as well.\\n\\nWALLACE: Senator Rubio, when Jeb Bush announced his candidacy for presidency, he said this: \"There\\'s no passing off responsibility when you\\'re a governor, no blending into the legislative crowd.\"\\n\\nCould you please address Governor Bush across the stage here, and explain to him why you, someone who has never held executive office, are better prepared to be president than he is, a man who you say did a great job running your state of Florida for eight years.\\n\\nRUBIO: Well, thank you for the question, Chris, and it\\'s great to be here tonight. Let me begin by saying this: I\\'m not new to the political process; I was making a contribution as the speaker of the third largest and most diverse state in the country well before I even got into the Senate.\\n\\nI would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition. It\\'s important to be qualified, but if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton\\'s gonna be the next president, because she\\'s been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight.\\n\\nHere\\'s what this election better be about: This election better be about the future, not the past. It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced.\\n\\nThis country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed. You know, the largest retailer in the country and the world today, Amazon, doesn\\'t even own a single store? And these changes have been disruptive. They have changed people\\'s lives. The jobs that once sustained our middle class, they either don\\'t pay enough or they are gone, and we need someone that understands that as our nominee.\\n\\nIf I\\'m our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised paycheck to paycheck. How is she -- how is she gonna lecture me -- how is she gonna lecture me about student loans? I owed over $100,000 just four years ago.\\n\\nIf I\\'m our nominee, we will be the party of the future. [applause]\\n\\nBAIER: Governor Bush, you have insisted that you\\'re your own man. You say you have a life experience uniquely your own. Not your father\\'s, not your brother\\'s.\\n\\nBut there are several opponents on this stage who get big- applause lines in early voting states with this line: quote, \"the last thing the country needs is another Bush in the Oval Office.\"\\n\\nSo do you understand the real concern in this country about dynastic politics?\\n\\nBUSH: Absolutely, I do, and I\\'m gonna run hard, run with heart, and run to win.\\n\\nI\\'m gonna have to earn this. Maybe the barrier -- the bar\\'s even higher for me. That\\'s fine.\\n\\nI\\'ve got a record in Florida. I\\'m proud of my dad, and I\\'m certainly proud of my brother. In Florida, they called me Jeb, because I earned it.\\n\\nI cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion. We were -- we had -- we balanced every budget. We went from $1 billion of reserves to $9 billion of reserves.\\n\\nWe were one of two states that went to AAA bond rating.\\n\\nThey keep -- they called me Veto Corleone. Because I vetoed 2,500 separate line-items in the budget. [applause]\\n\\nI am my own man. I governed as a conservative, and I govern effectively. And the net effect was, during my eight years, 1.3 million jobs were created. We left the state better off because I applied conservative principles in a purple state the right way, and people rose up. [applause]\\n\\nKELLY: Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don\\'t use a politician\\'s filter. However, that is not without its downsides, in particular, when it comes to women.\\n\\nYou\\'ve called women you don\\'t like \"fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.\" [laughter] Your Twitter account...\\n\\nTRUMP: Only Rosie O\\'Donnell. [laughter]\\n\\nKELLY: No, it wasn\\'t. [applause] Your Twitter account... [applause]\\n\\nTRUMP: Thank you.\\n\\nKELLY: For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O\\'Donnell.\\n\\nTRUMP: Yes, I\\'m sure it was.\\n\\nKELLY: Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women\\'s looks. You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president, and how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who was likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women?\\n\\nTRUMP: I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct. [applause]\\n\\nI\\'ve been challenged by so many people, and I don\\'t frankly have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn\\'t have time either. This country is in big trouble. We don\\'t win anymore. We lose to China. We lose to Mexico both in trade and at the border. We lose to everybody.\\n\\nAnd frankly, what I say, and oftentimes it\\'s fun, it\\'s kidding. We have a good time. What I say is what I say. And honestly Megyn, if you don\\'t like it, I\\'m sorry. I\\'ve been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me. But I wouldn\\'t do that. [applause]\\n\\nBut you know what, we -- we need strength, we need energy, we need quickness and we need brain in this country to turn it around. That, I can tell you right now.\\n\\nWALLACE: Senator Cruz, your colleague, Senator Paul, right there next to you, said a few months ago he agrees with you on a number of issues, but he says you do nothing to grow the party. He says you feed red meat to the base, but you don\\'t reach out to minorities. You have a toxic relationship with GOP leaders in Congress. You even called the Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell a liar recently. [applause]\\n\\nHow can you win in 2016 when you\\'re such a divisive figure?\\n\\nCRUZ: Chris, I believe the American people are looking for someone to speak the truth. [applause]\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for someone to go to Washington, to go along to get along, to get -- to agree with the career politicians in both parties who get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests, then I ain\\'t your guy.\\n\\nThere is a reason... [applause] .... that we have $18 trillion in debt. Because as conservatives, as Republicans, we keep winning elections. We got a Republican House, we\\'ve got a Republican Senate, and we don\\'t have leaders who honor their commitments. I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would do. [applause]\\n\\nBAIER: Governor Christie, you\\'re not exactly the darling of conservatives. You tout your record as a Republican governor in a blue state. On Facebook, the most people talking about you, not surprisingly, come from your state of New Jersey, and one of the top issues they are talking about is the economy.\\n\\nThis -- this may be why. Under your watch, New Jersey has undergone nine credit rating downgrades. The state\\'s 44th in private sector growth. You face an employee pension crisis and the Garden State has the third highest foreclosure rate in the country. So why should voters believe that your management of the country\\'s finances would be any different?\\n\\nCHRISTIE: If you think it\\'s bad now, you should\\'ve seen it when I got there. [laught and applause]\\n\\nThe fact is -- the fact is, in the eight years before I became governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times. In the eight years before I became governor, spending was increased 56 percent. And in the eight years before I become governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times.\\n\\nIn the eight years before I became Governor, spending was increased 56 percent, and in the eight years before I became governor, there was zero net private sector job growth in New Jersey. Zero. For eight years.\\n\\nSo, what did we do? We came in, we balanced an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget by cutting over 800 programs in the state budget. We brought the budget into balance with no tax increases. In fact, we vetoed five income tax increases during my time as governor. We cut business taxes $2.3 billion, and we cut regulation by one-third of what my predecessor put in place.\\n\\nAnd, what\\'s happened since? A hundred ninety-two thousand private sector jobs in the five and a half years I\\'ve been governor. We have a lot of work to do in New Jersey, but I am darn proud we\\'ve brought our state back. [applause]\\n\\nKELLY: Governor Walker, you\\'ve consistently said that you want to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. You recently signed an abortion law in Wisconsin that does have an exception for the mother\\'s life, but you\\'re on the record as having objected to it. Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion, and with 83 percent of the American public in favor of a life exception, are you too out of the mainstream on this issue to win the general election?\\n\\nWALKER: Well, I\\'m pro-life, I\\'ve always been pro-life, and I\\'ve got a position that I think is consistent with many Americans out there in that... [applause] ...in that I believe that that is an unborn child that\\'s in need of protection out there, and I\\'ve said many a time that that unborn child can be protected, and there are many other alternatives that can also protect the life of that mother. That\\'s been consistently proven.\\n\\nUnlike Hillary Clinton, who has a radical position in terms of support for Planned Parenthood, I defunded Planned Parenthood more than four years ago, long before any of these videos came out... [applause] ...I\\'ve got a position that\\'s in line with everyday America. [applause]\\n\\nWALLACE: Governor Huckabee, like Governor Walker, you have staked out strong positions on social issues. You favor a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage. You favor a constitutional amendment banning abortions, except for the life of the mother. Millions of people in this country agree with you, but according to the polls, and again this an electability question, according to the polls, more people don\\'t, so how do you persuade enough Independents and Democrats to get elected in 2016?\\n\\nHUCKABEE: Chris, I disagree with the idea that the real issue is a constitutional amendment. That\\'s a long and difficult process. I\\'ve actually taken the position that\\'s bolder than that.\\n\\nA lot of people are talking about defunding planned parenthood, as if that\\'s a huge game changer. I think it\\'s time to do something even more bold. I think the next president ought to invoke the Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the constitution now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mother\\'s womb is a person at the moment of conception.\\n\\nThe reason we know that it is is because of the DNA schedule that we now have clear scientific evidence on. And, this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn child\\'s Fifth and 14th Amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law.\\n\\nIt\\'s time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being, and we change the policy to be pro-life and protect children instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like they\\'re parts to a Buick. [applause]\\n\\nBAIER: Senator Paul, you recently blamed the rise of ISIS on Republican hawks. You later said that that statement, you could have said it better. But, the statement went on, and you said, quote, \"Everything they\\'ve talked about in foreign policy, they\\'ve been wrong for the last 20 years.\"\\n\\nWhy are you so quick to blame your own party?\\n\\nPAUL: First of all, only ISIS is responsible for the terrorism. Only ISIS is responsible for the depravity. But, we do have to examine, how are we going to defeat ISIS?\\n\\nI\\'ve got a proposal. I\\'m the leading voice in America for not arming the allies of ISIS. [applause] I\\'ve been fighting amidst a lot of opposition from both Hillary Clinton, as well as some Republicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS. ISIS rides around in a billion dollars worth of U.S. Humvees. It\\'s a disgrace. We\\'ve got to stop -- we shouldn\\'t fund our enemies, for goodness sakes. So, we didn\\'t create ISIS -- ISIS created themselves, but we will stop them, and one of the ways we stop them is by not funding them, and not arming them. [applause]\\n\\nKELLY: Governor Kasich, You chose to expand Medicaid in your state, unlike several other governors on this stage tonight, and it is already over budget by some estimates costing taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion in just the first 18 months.\\n\\nYou defended your Medicaid expansion by invoking God, saying to skeptics that when they arrive in heaven, Saint Peter isn\\'t going to ask them how small they\\'ve kept government, but what they have done for the poor.\\n\\nWhy should Republican voters, who generally want to shrink government, believe that you won\\'t use your Saint Peter rationale to expand every government program?\\n\\nKASICH: Well, first of all... [applause] ...first of all, Megyn, you should know that -- that President Reagan expanded Medicaid three or four times.\\n\\nSecondly, I had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio to do what?\\n\\nTo treat the mentally ill. Ten thousand of them sit in our prisons. It costs $22,500 a year... [applause] ...to keep them in prison. I\\'d rather get them their medication so they could lead a decent life.\\n\\nSecondly, we are rehabbing the drug-addicted. Eighty percent of the people in our prisons have addictions or problems. We now treat them in the prisons, release them in the community and the recidivism rate is 10 percent and everybody across this country knows that the tsunami of drugs is -- is threatening their very families.\\n\\nSo we\\'re treating them and getting them on their feet. And, finally, the working poor, instead of them having come into the emergency rooms where it costs more, where they\\'re sicker and we end up paying, we brought a program in here to make sure that people could get on their feet.\\n\\nAnd do you know what?\\n\\nEverybody has a right to their God-given purpose.\\n\\nAnd finally, our Medicaid is growing at one of the lowest rates in the country. And, finally, we went from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black. We\\'ve cut $5 billion in taxes... [timer sounds] ...and we\\'ve grown 350,000 jobs. [applause]\\n\\nWALLACE: Gentlemen, we\\'re turning to a new subject that all of you have been talking about and some of you have been disagreeing about, and that is the issue of immigration.\\n\\nGovernor Bush, you released a new plan this week on illegal immigration focusing on enforcement, which some suggest is your effort to show that you\\'re not soft on that issue.\\n\\nI want to ask you about a statement that you made last year about illegal immigrants. And here\\'s what you said. \"They broke the law, but it\\'s not a felony, it\\'s an act of love. It\\'s an act of commitment to your family.\"\\n\\nDo you stand by that statement and do you stand by your support for earned legal status?\\n\\nBUSH: I do. I believe that the great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option. They want to provide for their family.\\n\\nBut we need to control our border. It\\'s not -- it\\'s our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in. So I -- I\\'ve written a book about this and yet this week, I did come up with a comprehensive strategy that -- that really mirrored what we said in the book, which is that we need to deal with E-Verify, we need to deal with people that come with a legal visa and overstay.\\n\\nWe need to be much more strategic on how we deal with border enforcement, border security. We need to eliminate the sanctuary cities in this country. It is ridiculous and tragic...[applause]...that people are dying because of the fact that -- that local governments are not following the federal law. There\\'s much to do. And I think rather than talking about this as a wedge issue, which Barack Obama has done now for six long years, the next president -- and I hope to be that president -- will fix this once and for all so that we can turn this into a driver for high sustained economic growth.\\n\\nAnd there should be a path to earned legal status...[timer sounds] ...for those that are here. Not -- not amnesty, earned legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time.\\n\\nWALLACE: Thank you, sir. [applause] Mr. Trump, it has not escaped anybody\\'s notice that you say that the Mexican government, the Mexican government is sending criminals -- rapists, drug dealers, across the border.\\n\\nGovernor Bush has called those remarks, quote, \"extraordinarily ugly.\"\\n\\nI\\'d like you -- you\\'re right next to him -- tell us -- talk to him directly and say how you respond to that and -- and you have repeatedly said that you have evidence that the Mexican government is doing this, but you have evidence you have refused or declined to share.\\n\\nWhy not use this first Republican presidential debate to share your proof with the American people?\\n\\nTRUMP: So, if it weren\\'t for me, you wouldn\\'t even be talking about illegal immigration, Chris. You wouldn\\'t even be talking about it. [applause] This was not a subject that was on anybody\\'s mind until I brought it up at my announcement. And I said, Mexico is sending. Except the reporters, because they\\'re a very dishonest lot, generally speaking, in the world of politics, they didn\\'t cover my statement the way I said it.\\n\\nThe fact is, since then, many killings ,murders, crime, drugs pouring across the border, are money going out and the drugs coming in. And I said we need to build a wall, and it has to be built quickly.\\n\\nAnd I don\\'t mind having a big beautiful door in that wall so that people can come into this country legally. But we need, Jeb, to build a wall, we need to keep illegals out. [cheering and applause]\\n\\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump, I\\'ll give you 30 seconds -- I\\'ll give you 30 seconds to answer my question, which was, what evidence do you have, specific evidence that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border? Thirty seconds.\\n\\nTRUMP: Border Patrol, I was at the border last week. Border Patrol, people that I deal with, that I talk to, they say this is what\\'s happening. Because our leaders are stupid. Our politicians are stupid.\\n\\nAnd the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don\\'t want to pay for them. They don\\'t want to take care of them.\\n\\nWhy should they when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them? And that\\'s what is happening whether you like it or not. [cheering and applause]\\n\\nWALLACE: All right. Obviously there\\'s a lot more to talk about this. We\\'re going to have more questions for the candidates on illegal immigration, plus other key topics including your questions on Facebook.\\n\\n[video clip begins]\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What will be your plan on making immigration easier for those that want to do it legally?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What specific steps would you take to contain the growth of ISIS?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I\\'d like to know what the candidates are going to do so that I feel safe in my own country again.\\n\\n[video clip ends]\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\nWALLACE: Welcome back to FOX News/Facebook Republican Debate Night. We\\'re going to continue the questions now on illegal immigration. We kind of ended with a cliffhanger there. So let\\'s continue the conversation.\\n\\nGovernor Kasich, I know you don\\'t like to talk about Donald Trump. But I do want to ask you about the merit of what he just said. When you say that the American government is stupid, that the Mexican government is sending criminals, that we\\'re being bamboozled, is that an adequate response to the question of illegal immigration?\\n\\nKASICH: Chris, first of all, I was just saying to Chris Christie, they say we\\'re outspoken, we need to take lessons from Donald Trump if we\\'re really going to learn it. Here is the thing about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is hitting a nerve in this country. He is. He\\'s hitting a nerve. People are frustrated. They\\'re fed up. They don\\'t think the government is working for them. And for people who want to just tune him out, they\\'re making a mistake.\\n\\nNow, he\\'s got his solutions. Some of us have other solutions. You know, look, I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington. Hasn\\'t been done since. I was a military reformer. I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole and a 350,000 job loss to a $2 billion surplus and a gain of 350,000 jobs.\\n\\nWALLACE: Respectfully, can we talk about illegal immigration?\\n\\nKASICH: But the point is that we all have solutions. Mr. Trump is touching a nerve because people want the wall to be built. They want to see an end to illegal immigration. They want to see it, and we all do. But we all have different ways of getting there. And you\\'re going to hear from all of us tonight about what our ideas are.\\n\\nWALLACE: All right, well, Senator Rubio, let me see if I can do better with you. Is it as simple as our leaders are stupid, their leaders are smart, and all of these illegals coming over are criminals?\\n\\nRUBIO: Let me set the record straight on a couple of things. The first is, the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico. They\\'re coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras. Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority.\\n\\nI also believe we need a fence. The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too. And that\\'s why you need an e-verify system and you need an entry-exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration. But I agree with what Governor Kasich just said. People are frustrated. This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like we\\'re being taken advantage of. We feel like despite our generosity, we\\'re being taken advantage of.\\n\\nAnd let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates. The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States. And they\\'ve paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can\\'t get in. And they\\'re wondering, maybe they should come illegally. [applause]\\n\\nAnd so these are important issues, and we should address it. It\\'s a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and otherwise we\\'re going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years, like we have for the last 30 years.\\n\\nWALLACE: Governor Walker. [applause]\\n\\nGovernor Walker, from 2002 until as recently as 2013, just two years ago, you supported comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship. Now you say that was a quick reaction to something you hadn\\'t really thought about, and that you\\'ve changed your mind. Other than politics, could you explain why in the last two years you\\'ve changed your position on a path to citizenship, and are there other past positions that we shouldn\\'t hold you to?\\n\\nWALKER: Chris, I actually said that on your show earlier this year. [crosstalk] I acknowledged that. I said I actually listened to the American people. And I think people across America want a leader who\\'s actually going to listen to them.\\n\\nI talked to border state governors and other elected officials. I look at how this president, particularly through last November, messed up the immigration system in this country. Most importantly, I listened to the people of America.\\n\\nI believe we need to secure the border. I\\'ve been to the border with Governor Abbott in Texas and others, seeing the problems that they have there. There is international criminal organizations penetrating our southern based borders, and we need to do something about it. Secure the border, enforce the law, no amnesty, and go forward with the legal immigration system that gives priority to American working families and wages. [applause]\\n\\nWALLACE: Senator Cruz, some 1,400 people submitted questions on this very hot topic of illegal immigration on Facebook, and a number of them were about the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco, allegedly shot down by an illegal. Doug Bettencourt sent this question, \"will you support Kate Steinle\\'s Law,\" which would impose a mandatory five-year prison term for an illegal who is deported and then returns to this country? \"And will you defund sanctuary cities for violating federal law?\"\\n\\nCRUZ: Chris, absolutely yes. And not only will I support it...[applause]...I have authored Kate\\'s law in the United States Senate and filed that legislation. I tried to get the Senate to vote to pass Kate\\'s law on the floor of the Senate just one week ago, and the leader of our own party blocked a vote on Kate\\'s law.\\n\\nYou know, there was reference made to our leaders being stupid. It\\'s not a question of stupidity. It\\'s that they don\\'t want to enforce the immigration laws. That there are far too many in the Washington cartel that support amnesty.\\n\\nPresident Obama has talked about fundamentally transforming this country. There\\'s 7 billion people across the face of the globe, many of whom want to come to this country. If they come legally, great. But if they come illegally and they get amnesty, that is how we fundamentally change this country, and it really is striking.\\n\\nA majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty. I have never supported amnesty, and I led the fight against Chuck Schumer\\'s gang of eight amnesty legislation in the Senate.\\n\\nKELLY: Alright, gentlemen, we\\'re gonna switch topics now and talk a bit about terror and national security.\\n\\nGovernor Christie. You\\'ve said that Senator Paul\\'s opposition to the NSA\\'s collection of phone records has made the United States weaker and more vulnerable, even going so far as to say that he should be called before Congress to answer for it if we should be hit by another terrorist attack.\\n\\nDo you really believe you can assign blame to Senator Paul just for opposing the bulk collection of people\\'s phone records in the event of a terrorist attack?\\n\\nCHRISTIE: Yes, I do. And I\\'ll tell you why: because I\\'m the only person on this stage who\\'s actually filed applications under the Patriot Act, who has gone before the federal -- the Foreign Intelligence Service court, who has prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after September 11th.\\n\\nI was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on September 10th, 2001, and the world changed enormously the next day, and that happened in my state.\\n\\nThis is not theoretical to me. I went to the funerals. We lost friends of ours in the Trade Center that day. My own wife was two blocks from the Trade Center that day, at her office, having gone through it that morning.\\n\\nWhen you actually have to be responsible for doing this, you can do it, and we did it, for seven years in my office, respecting civil liberties and protecting the homeland.\\n\\nAnd I will make no apologies, ever, for protecting the lives and the safety of the American people. We have to give more tools to our folks to be able to do that, not fewer, and then trust those people and oversee them to do it the right way. As president, that is exactly what I\\'ll do.\\n\\nPAUL: Megyn, may I respond? [applause] May I respond?\\n\\nKELLY: Go ahead, sir.\\n\\nPAUL: I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from innocent Americans. The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over! John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence, and I\\'m proud of standing for the Bill of Rights, and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights. [applause]\\n\\nCHRISTIE: And -- and, Megyn? Megyn, that\\'s a -- that, you know, that\\'s a completely ridiculous answer. \"I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from other people.\" How are you supposed to know, Megyn?\\n\\nPAUL: Use the Fourth Amendment!\\n\\nCHRISTIE: What are you supposed to...\\n\\nPAUL: Use the Fourth Amendment!\\n\\nCHRISTIE: ...how are you supposed to -- no, I\\'ll tell you how you, look...\\n\\nPAUL: Get a warrant!\\n\\nCHRISTIE: Let me tell you something, you go...\\n\\nPAUL: Get a judge to sign the warrant!\\n\\nCHRISTIE: When you -- you know, senator...\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\nKELLY: Governor Christie, make your point.\\n\\nCHRISTIE: Listen, senator, you know, when you\\'re sitting in a subcommittee, just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that. [applause]\\n\\nWhen you\\'re responsible for protecting the lives of the American people, then what you need to do is to make sure...\\n\\nPAUL: See, here\\'s the problem.\\n\\nCHRISTIE: ...is to make sure that you use the system the way it\\'s supposed to work.\\n\\nPAUL: Here\\'s the problem, governor. Here\\'s the problem, governor. You fundamentally misunderstand the Bill of Rights.\\n\\nEvery time you did a case, you got a warrant from a judge. I\\'m talking about searches without warrants...\\n\\nCHRISTIE: There is no...\\n\\nPAUL: ...indiscriminately, of all Americans\\' records, and that\\'s what I fought to end.\\n\\nI don\\'t trust President Obama with our records. I know you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead. [applause]\\n\\nKELLY: Go ahead, governor.\\n\\nCHRISTIE: And you know -- you know, Senator Paul? Senator Paul, you know, the hugs that I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families who lost their people on September 11th.\\n\\nThose are the hugs I remember, and those had nothing to do -- and those had nothing to do with politics, unlike what you\\'re doing by cutting speeches on the floor of the Senate, then putting them on the Internet within half an hour to raise money for your campaign...\\n\\nKELLY: Alright.\\n\\nCHRISTIE: ...and while still putting our country at risk.\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\nKELLY: Alright, we\\'ve gotta cut it off there.\\n\\nWe have plenty more we want to get to. That was an interesting exchange, thank you for that.\\n\\nCHRISTIE: You know what, Megyn, can I...\\n\\nKELLY: Well, I want to move on, because I have -- we\\'re gonna get to you, governor, but I -- I really wanna get to a Facebook questioner. His name is Alex Chalgren, and he has the following question:\\n\\n[video clip begins]\\n\\nQUESTION:: My question is, how would the candidates stop the treacherous actions of ISIS -- ISIL and its growing influence in the U.S., if they were to become president?\\n\\n[video clip ends]\\n\\nKELLY: Senator Cruz, I wanna talk to you about this, because many of the Facebook users and -- and -- the -- the folks on Facebook wanted the candidates to speak to ISIS tonight.\\n\\nYou asked the chairman of the joint chiefs a question: \"What would it take to destroy ISIS in 90 days?\" He told you \"IISIS will only be truly destroyed once they are rejected by the populations in which they hide.\" And then you accused him of pushing Medicaid for the Iraqis.\\n\\nHow would you destroy ISIS in 90 days?\\n\\nCRUZ: Megyn, we need a commander in chief that speaks the truth. We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words, \"radical Islamic terrorism\". [applause]\\n\\nWhen I asked General Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs, what would be required militarily to destroy ISIS, he said there is no military solution. We need to change the conditions on the ground so that young men are not in poverty and susceptible to radicalization. That, with all due respect, is nonsense.\\n\\nIt\\'s the same answer the State Department gave that we need to give them jobs. What we need is a commander in chief who makes -- clear, if you join ISIS, if you wage jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant.\\n\\nKELLY: You don\\'t see it as... [applause] ...an ideological problem -- an ideological problem in addition to a military one? [applause]\\n\\nCRUZ: Megyn, of course it\\'s an ideological problem, that\\'s one of the reasons I introduce the Expatriate Terrorist Act in the Senate that said if any American travels to the Middle East and joining ISIS, that he or she forfeits their citizenship so they don\\'t use a passport to come back and wage jihad on Americans. [applause]\\n\\nYes, it is ideological, and let me contrast President Obama, who at the prayer breakfast, essentially acted as an apologist. He said, \"Well, gosh, the crusades, the inquisitions--\"[timer sounds]\\n\\nWe need a president that shows the courage that Egypt\\'s President al-Sisi did, a Muslim, when he called out the radical Islamic terrorists who are threatening the world. [applause]\\n\\nKELLY: Governor Bush, for days on end in this campaign, you struggled to answer a question about whether knowing what we know now...\\n\\nBUSH: ...I remember...\\n\\nKELLY: ...we would\\'ve invaded Iraq...\\n\\nBUSH: ...I remember, Megyn. [laughter]\\n\\nKELLY: I remember it too, and ISIS, of course, is now thriving there.\\n\\nYou finally said, \"No.\"\\n\\nTo the families of those who died in that war who say they liberated a country and deposed a ruthless dictator, how do you look at them now and say that your brothers war was a mistake?\\n\\nBUSH: Knowing what we know now, with faulty intelligence, and not having security be the first priority when -- when we invaded, it was a mistake. I wouldn\\'t have gone in, however, for the people that did lose their lives, and the families that suffer because of it -- I know this full well because as governor of the state of Florida, I called every one of them. Every one of them that I could find to tell them that I was praying for them, that I cared about them, and it was really hard to do.\\n\\nAnd, every one of them said that their child did not die in vain, or their wife, of their husband did not die in vain.\\n\\nSo, why it was difficult for me to do it was based on that. Here\\'s the lesson that we should take from this, which relates to this whole subject. Barack Obama became president, and he abandoned Iraq. He left, and when he left Al Qaida was done for. ISIS was created because [timer sounds] of the void that we left, and that void now exists as a caliphate the size of Indiana.\\n\\nTo honor the people that died, we need to -- we need to --- stop the -- Iran agreement, for sure, because the Iranian mullahs have their blood on their hands, and we need to take out ISIS with every tool at our disposal. [applause]\\n\\nKELLY: Governor Walker, in February you said that we needed to gain partners in the Arab world. Which Arab country not already in the U.S. led coalition has potential to be our greatest partner?\\n\\nWALKER: I don\\'t know about additional ones. We need to focus on the ones we have. You look at Egypt, probably the best relationship we\\'ve had in Israel, at least in my lifetime, incredibly important.\\n\\nYou look at the Saudis -- in fact, earlier this year, I met with Saudi leaders, and leaders from the United Arab Emirates, and I asked them what\\'s the greatest challenge in the world today? Set aside the Iran deal. They said it\\'s the disengagement of America. We are leading from behind under the Obama-Clinton doctrine -- America\\'s a great country. We need to stand up and start leading again, and we need to have allies, not just in Israel, but throughout the Persian Gulf.\\n\\nKELLY: Dr. Carson, in one of his first acts as commander in chief, President Obama signed an executive order banning enhanced interrogation techniques in fighting terror. As president, would you bring back water boarding?\\n\\nCARSON: Well, thank you, Megyn, I wasn\\'t sure I was going to get to talk again. [applause]\\n\\nKELLY: We have a lot for you, don\\'t worry. [laughter and applause] Fear not, you may rue that request.\\n\\nCARSON: Alright. You know, what we do in order to get the information that we need is our business, and I wouldn\\'t necessarily be broadcasting what we\\'re going to do. [applause]\\n\\nWe. . .uh. . .we\\'ve gotten into this -- this mindset of fighting politically correct wars. There is no such thing as a politically correct war. [applause]\\n\\nAnd, the left, of course, will say Carson doesn\\'t believe in the Geneva Convention. Carson doesn\\'t believe in fighting stupid wars. And -- and what we have to remember is we want to utilize the tremendous intellect that we have in the military to win wars.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ve talked to a lot of the generals, a lot of our advanced people. And believe me, if we gave them the mission, which is what the commander-in-chief does, they would be able to carry it out.\\n\\nAnd if we don\\'t tie their hands behind their back, they will do it...[timer sounds]...extremely effectively. [applause]\\n\\nBAIER: Gentlemen, the next series of questions deals with ObamaCare and the role of the federal government.\\n\\nMr. Trump, ObamaCare is one of the things you call a disaster.\\n\\nTRUMP: A complete disaster, yes.\\n\\nBAIER: Saying it needs to be repealed and replaced.\\n\\nTRUMP: Correct.\\n\\nBAIER: Now, 15 years ago, you called yourself a liberal on health care. You were for a single-payer system, a Canadian-style system.\\n\\nWhy were you for that then and why aren\\'t you for it now?\\n\\nTRUMP: First of all, I\\'d like to just go back to one. In July of 2004, I came out strongly against the war with Iraq, because it was going to destabilize the Middle East. And I\\'m the only one on this stage that knew that and had the vision to say it. And that\\'s exactly what happened.\\n\\nBAIER: But on ObamaCare...\\n\\nTRUMP: And the Middle East became totally destabilized. So I just want to say.\\n\\nAs far as single payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you\\'re talking about here.\\n\\nWhat I\\'d like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state. I have a big company with thousands and thousands of employees. And if I\\'m negotiating in New York or in New Jersey or in California, I have like one bidder. Nobody can bid.\\n\\nYou know why?\\n\\nBecause the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians, of course, with the exception of the politicians on this stage.\\n\\nBut they have total control of the politicians. They\\'re making a fortune.\\n\\nGet rid of the artificial lines and you will have...[timer sounds]...yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the people that can\\'t take care of themselves. And I will do that through a different system.\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\nBAIER: Mr. Trump, hold up one second.\\n\\nPAUL: I\\'ve got a news flash...\\n\\nBAIER: All right, now, hold on, Senator Paul...\\n\\nPAUL: News flash, the Republican Party\\'s been fighting against a single-payer system...\\n\\nBAIER: OK.\\n\\nPAUL: -- for a decade. So I think you\\'re on the wrong side of this if you\\'re still arguing for a single-payer system.\\n\\nTRUMP: I\\'m not -- I\\'m not are -- I don\\'t think you heard me. You\\'re having a hard time tonight.\\n\\nBAIER: All right, let me... [applause]\\n\\nMr. Trump, it\\'s not just your past support for single- payer health care. You\\'ve also supported a host of other liberal policies. Use -- you\\'ve also donated to several Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton included, Nancy Pelosi.\\n\\nYou explained away those donations saying you did that to get business-related favors.\\n\\nAnd you said recently, quote, \"When you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.\"\\n\\nTRUMP: You\\'d better believe it.\\n\\nBAIER: So what specifically did...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: That\\'s true.\\n\\nBAIER: -- they do?\\n\\nTRUMP: If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I\\'ve given to, just so you understand, a lot of money.\\n\\nRUBIO: Not me.\\n\\nHUCKABEE: Not me. [laughter] But you\\'re welcome to give me a check, Donald if you\\'d like.\\n\\nTRUMP: Many of them.\\n\\nRUBIO: Actually, to be clear...[crosstalk]...he supported Charlie Crist.\\n\\nTRUMP: Not much.\\n\\nRUBIO: Hey, Charlie...[crosstalk]\\n\\nTRUMP: But I...[crosstalk]\\n\\nKASICH: Donald, if you...[crosstalk]\\n\\nTRUMP: I have good...\\n\\nKASICH: -- this campaign, I hope you will give to me.\\n\\nTRUMP: Good.\\n\\nKASICH: OK.\\n\\nTRUMP: Sounds good. Sounds good to me, Governor.\\n\\nI will tell you that our system is broken. I gave to many people, before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give.\\n\\nAnd do you know what?\\n\\nWhen I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: So what did you get?\\n\\nTRUMP: And that\\'s a broken system.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did you get from Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi?\\n\\nTRUMP: Well, I\\'ll tell you what, with Hillary Clinton, I said be at my wedding and she came to my wedding.\\n\\nYou know why?\\n\\nShe didn\\'t have a choice because I gave. I gave to a foundation that, frankly, that foundation is supposed to do good. I didn\\'t know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world. It was.\\n\\nBut...[timer sounds] [crosstalk]\\n\\nBAIER: Hold on.\\n\\nWe\\'re going to -- we\\'re going to move on. [crosstalk] We\\'ll come back to you, Governor Walker.\\n\\nWALKER: Just one second on this, though.\\n\\nWe -- we spent a lot of time talking about Hillary Clinton and ---and pitting us back and forth.\\n\\nLet\\'s be clear, we should be talking about Hillary Clinton on that last subject, because everywhere in the world that Hillary Clinton touched is more messed up today than before she and the president [inaudible].\\n\\nBAIER: We have many questions to come.\\n\\nWALKER: It\\'s true.\\n\\nBAIER: Many questions to come. [applause] Governor Huckabee, on Facebook, John Pietricone asked this, \"Will you abolish or take away the powers and cut the size of the EPA, the IRS, the Department of Education?\"\\n\\nNow, broadly... [applause] ...broadly, the size of government is a big concern for Facebook users, Facebook persons, as well as, obviously, conservatives.\\n\\nBut year after year, decade after decade, there are promises from Republicans to shrink government. But year after year, decade after decade, it doesn\\'t happen.\\n\\nIn fact, it gets bigger, even under Republican politicians.\\n\\nSo the question is, at this point, is the government simply too big for any one person, even a Republican, to shrink?\\n\\nHUCKABEE: It\\'s not too big to shrink. But the problem is we have a Wall Street-to-Washington axis of power that has controlled the political climate. The donor class feeds the political class who does the dance that the donor class wants. And the result is federal government keeps getting bigger.\\n\\nEvery person on this stage who has been a governor will tell that you the biggest fight they had was not the other party. Wasn\\'t even the legislature. It was the federal government, who continually put mandates on the states that we had to suck up and pay for.\\n\\nAnd the fact is there are a lot of things happening at the federal level that are absolutely beyond the jurisdiction of the Constitution. This is power that should be shifted back to the states, whether it\\'s the EPA, there is no role at the federal level for the Department of Education. [cheering and applause]\\n\\nAnd I\\'m still one who says that we can get rid of the Internal Revenue Service if we would pass the FairTax, which is a tax on consumption rather than a tax on people\\'s income, and move power back where the founders believed it should have been all along.\\n\\nBAIER: Dr. Carson...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bret, Bret, Bret...\\n\\nBAIER: Dr. Carson, do you agree with that?\\n\\nCARSON: What I agree with is that we need a significantly changed taxation system. And the one that I\\'ve advocated is based on tithing, because I think God is a pretty fair guy.\\n\\nAnd he said, you know, if you give me a tithe, it doesn\\'t matter how much you made. If you\\'ve had a bumper crop, you don\\'t owe me triple tithes. And if you\\'ve had no crops at all, you don\\'t owe me no tithes. So there must be something inherently fair about that.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s why I\\'ve advocated a proportional tax system. You make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10, you pay one. And everybody gets treated the same way. And you get rid of the deductions, you get rid of all the loopholes, and...[timer sounds]\\n\\nBAIER: Governor Bush?\\n\\nCARSON: And I have a lot more to say about it.\\n\\nBAIER: We\\'re going to come back to you, Dr. Carson.\\n\\nGovernor Bush, you are one of the few people on the stage who advocates for Common Core education standards, reading and math. A lot of people on this stage vigorously oppose a federal involvement in education. They say it should all be handled locally.\\n\\nPresident Obama\\'s secretary of education, Arnie Duncan, has said that most of the criticism of Common Core is due to a, quote, \"fringe group of critics.\" Do you think that\\'s accurate?\\n\\nBUSH: No, I don\\'t. And I don\\'t believe the federal government should be involved in the creation of standards directly or indirectly, the creation of curriculum or content. It is clearly a state responsibility.\\n\\nI\\'m for higher standards... [applause] ...measured in an intellectually honest way, with abundant school choice, ending social promotion. And I know how to do this because as governor of the state of Florida I created the first statewide voucher program in the country, the second statewide voucher program, in the country and the third statewide voucher program in the country.\\n\\nAnd we had rising student achievement across the board, because high standards, robust accountability, ending social promotion in third grade, real school choice across the board, challenging the teachers union and beating them is the way to go.\\n\\nAnd Florida\\'s low income kids had the greatest gains inside the country. Our graduation rate improved by 50 percent. That\\'s what I\\'m for.\\n\\nBAIER: Senator Rubio, why is Governor Bush wrong on Common Core?\\n\\nRUBIO: Well, first off, I too believe in curriculum reform. It is critically important in the 21st Century. We do need curriculum reform. And it should happen at the state and local level. That\\'s. . . that\\'s. . . that is where educational policy belongs, because if a parent is unhappy with what their child is being taught in school, they can go to that local school board or their state legislature, or their governor and get it changed.\\n\\nHere\\'s the problem with Common Core. The Department of Education, like every federal agency, will never be satisfied. They will not stop with it being a suggestion. They will turn it into a mandate.\\n\\nIn fact, what they will begin to say to local communities is, you will not get federal money unless do you things the way we want you to do it. And they will use Common Core or any other requirements that exists nationally to force it down the throats of our people in our states. [applause]\\n\\nBAIER: And do you agree with your old friend?\\n\\nBUSH: He is definitely my friend. And I think the states ought to create these standards. And if states want to opt out of Common Core, fine. Just make sure your standards are high.\\n\\nBecause today in America, a third of our kids, after we spend more per student than any country in the world other than a couple rounding errors, to be honest with you, 30 percent are college- and/or career-ready.\\n\\nIf we are going to compete in this world we\\'re in today, there is no possible way we can do it with lowering expectations and dumbing down everything. Children are going to suffer and families\\' hearts are going to be broken that their kids won\\'t be able to get a job in the 21st Century. [applause]\\n\\nBAIER: We have many more questions coming on a host of topics, here from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. Stay with us.\\n\\n[video clip begins]\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What would make stand out as the best choice for the Republican nomination?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you intend to go about student loan reform?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What will be the first thing you will do to stimulate economic growth in our country and bring more jobs to the United States?\\n\\n[video clip ends]\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\nBAIER: We have many more questions coming on a host of topics. Here from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. Stay with us.\\n\\n[video clip begins]\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What would make you stand out as the best choice for the Republican nomination?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you intend to go about student loan reform?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What will be the first thing you will do to stimulate economic growth in our country and bring more jobs to the United States?\\n\\n[video clip ends]\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\nKELLY: It\\'s just before 10:00 p.m. on the East Coast. Welcome back to Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, and the very first Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential campaign. Ten candidates on the stage, selected based on their standing in five national polls. And tonight they are facing off, answering the questions you want asked. We hope. [laughter]\\n\\nWALLACE: Gentlemen, we\\'re obviously digging into some subjects in depth, but we\\'re also going to change it up every once in a while throughout the next hour and have many rounds where we ask, you are not going to like it, only a couple of candidates questions on those subjects. This is the first of the many rounds, and it\\'s about somebody whose name probably hasn\\'t been mentioned enough so far tonight.\\n\\nGovernor Kasich, let me start with you. Whoever the Republican nominee -- [applause]\\n\\nWhoever the Republican nominee is, it looks at least for now like whoever that nominee is, he or she, will be facing off against Hillary Clinton. You know how she will come after whoever the Republican nominee is. She will say that you, whoever it is, support the rich while she supports the middle class. That you want to suppress the rights of women and minorities. She wants to move the country forward while you, the Republicans, want to take the country back to the past.\\n\\nHow will you, if you\\'re the nominee, how will you answer that and take Hillary Clinton on?\\n\\nKASICH: Let\\'s start off with my father being a mailman. So I understand the concerns of all the folks across this country, some of whom have trouble, you know, making ends meet. But I think she will come in a narrow way. The nominee of this party, if they\\'re going to win, has got to come at it in a big way, which is pro-growth. Which is balancing budgets. You know, we were talking about it. People were saying, could we do it? I was the chairman of the Budget Committee and the lead architect the last time it happened in Washington, and when we did it we had great economic growth, we cut taxes, and we had a big surplus.\\n\\nEconomic growth is the key. Economic growth is the key to everything. But once you have economic growth, it is important that we reach out to people who live in the shadows, the people who don\\'t seem to ever think that they get a fair deal. And that includes people in our minority community; that includes people who feel as though they don\\'t have a chance to move up.\\n\\nYou know, America is a miracle country. And we have to restore the sense that the \"Amiracle\" will apply to you. Each and every one of the people in this country who\\'s watching tonight, lift everybody, [timer sounds] unite everybody and build a stronger United States of America again. It will be and can be done.\\n\\nWALLACE: I know that all of you would like to answer this question, but we\\'re only going to ask one other candidate before we move on to a different subject, Dr. Carson.\\n\\nBasically, same question to you. If Hillary Clinton is the nominee and she comes at you with that kind of line of attack, how will you take Iraq?\\n\\nCARSON: If Hillary is the candidate, which I doubt, that would be a dream come true. [laughter]\\n\\nBut you know, the fact of the matter is, she is the epitome of the progressive -- the secular progressive movement. And she counts on the fact that people are uninformed, the Alinsky Model, taking advantage of useful idiots.\\n\\nWell, I just happen to believe that people are not stupid. [applause] And the way I will come at it is to educate people, help people to actually understand that it is that progressive movement that is causing them the problems.\\n\\nYou know, you look at the -- the national debt and how it\\'s being driven up. If I was trying to destroy this country, what I would do is find a way to drive wedges between all the people, drive the debt to an unsustainable level, and then step off the stage as a world leader and let our enemies increase while we decreased our capacity as a military person. And that\\'s what she\\'s doing. [applause]\\n\\nWALLACE: Gentlemen, we\\'re going to turn now to the subject of the economy, jobs and money and the government. And Governor Bush, I\\'m going to start with you.\\n\\nYou have made a bold promise in your announcement. You have promised four percent economic growth and 19 million new jobs if you are fortunate enough to serve two terms as president.\\n\\nThat many jobs, 19 million, would be triple what your father and your brother accomplished together. And four percent growth, the last president to average that was Lyndon Johnson during the height of the Vietnam War. So question, how on Earth specifically would you pull that off?\\n\\nBUSH: We\\'ve done it 27 times since World War II. I think we need to lift our spirits and have high, lofty expectations for this great country of ours.\\n\\nThe new normal of two percent that the left is saying you can\\'t do anything about is so dangerous for our country. There\\'s 6 million people living in poverty today, more than when Barack Obama got elected. 6.5 million people are working part-time, most of whom want to work full-time. We\\'ve created rules and taxes on top of every aspiration of people, and the net result is we\\'re not growing fast, income\\'s not growing. A four percent growth strategy means you fix a convoluted tax code. You get in and you change every aspect of regulations that are job killers. You get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something that doesn\\'t suppress wages and kill jobs. [applause]\\n\\nYou embrace the energy revolution in our country. This president and Hillary Clinton, who can\\'t even say she\\'s for the XL pipeline even after she\\'s left? Give me a break. Of course we\\'re for it. We should be for these things to create high sustained economic growth. And frankly, [timer sounds] fixing our immigration system and turning it into an economic driver is part of this as well. We can do this. [applause]\\n\\nWALLACE: Governor Walker. [applause] Governor Walker, when you ran for governor of Wisconsin back in 2010, you promised that you would create 250,000 jobs in your first term, first four years. In fact, Wisconsin added barely half that and ranked 35th in the country in job growth. Now you\\'re running for president, and you\\'re promising an economic plan in which everyone will earn a piece of the American dream.\\n\\nGiven your record in Wisconsin, why should voters believe you?\\n\\nWALKER: Well, the voters in Wisconsin elected me last year for the third time because they wanted someone who aimed high, not aimed low.\\n\\nBefore I came in, the unemployment rate was over eight percent. It\\'s now down to 4.6 percent. We\\'ve more than made up for the jobs that were lost during the recession. And the rate in which people are working is almost five points higher than it is nationally.\\n\\nYou know, people like Hillary Clinton think you grow the economy by growing Washington. One report last year showed that six of the top 10 wealthiest counties in America were in or around Washington, D.C.. I think most of us in America understand that people, not the government creates jobs. And one of the best things we can do is get the government out of the way, repeal Obamacare, put in -- reign in all the out of control regulations, put in place an all of the above energy policy, give people the education, the skills that the need to succeed, and lower the tax rate and reform the tax code. That\\'s what I\\'ll do as president, just like I did in Wisconsin. [applause]\\n\\nWALLACE: Governor Christie, I want to engage you and Governor Huckabee in a subject that is a big issue in both of your campaigns, and that is entitlement reform.\\n\\nYou say that you -- to save the system that you want to raise the retirement age -- have to raise the retirement age, and to cut benefits for Social Security and Medicare, and you say that some of the candidates here on the stage are lying.\\n\\nGovernor Huckabee says he can save Social Security and Medicare without doing any of that. Is he lying?\\n\\nCHRISTIE: No, he\\'s not lying, he\\'s just wrong.\\n\\nI mean, so, there\\'s a difference -- I\\'m the only guy on this stage who\\'s put out a detailed, 12 point plan on entitlement reform and here\\'s why -- because 71% of federal spending right now is on entitlements, and debt service, 71%. And we have spent the last hour and five minutes talking about the other 29%, and no time on the 71%, and that makes no sense.\\n\\nNow, let me tell you exactly what we would do on Social Security. Yes, we\\'d raise the retirement age two years, and phase it in over 25 years, that means we\\'d raise it one month a year for 25 years when we\\'re all living longer, and living better lives.\\n\\nSecondly, we would means test Social Security for those who are making over $200,000 dollars a year in retirement income, and have $4 to $5 million dollars in liquid assets saved. They don\\'t need that Social Security check. Social Security is meant to be -- to make sure that no one who\\'s worked hard, and played by the rules, and paid into the system grows old in poverty in America.\\n\\nIf we don\\'t deal with this problem, it will bankrupt our country, or lead to massive tax increases, neither one that we want in this country. [applause]\\n\\nWALLACE: Governor Huckabee?\\n\\nYou say that changing entitlements, the kind of thing that Governor Christie is talking about, would be breaking a promise to the American people, and you say that you can keep those programs, save Social Security, save Medicare, without those kinds of reforms through a FairTax, which is a broad tax on consumption. Please explain to Governor Christie how that would work, and how you could save these programs without the kind of painful reforms he says we need?\\n\\nHUCKABEE: Well, let\\'s all be reminded, 60 million Americans are on Social Security, 60 million. A third of those people depend on 90% of their income from Social Security. Nobody in this country is on Social Security because they made the decision when they were starting work at 14 that they wanted to trust some of their money with the government.\\n\\nThe government took it out of their check whether they wanted them to or not. And, if person goes to 65, they\\'re going to spend 51 years with the government reaching into their pocket at every paycheck.\\n\\nNow, here\\'s the point, whose fault is it that the system is screwed up? Is it the recipients, or is it the government? And, if Congress wants to mess with the retirement program, why don\\'t we let them start by changing their retirement program, and not have one, instead of talking about getting rid of Social Security and Medicare that was robbed $700 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare.\\n\\nIt\\'s always that the government figures that they can do this off the backs of people, many of whom are poor, and depend on that money, and I just think it\\'s fundamentally lying to the people and stealing from them, and we shouldn\\'t be doing it. [applause]\\n\\nCHRISTIE: Chris...\\n\\nWALLACE: ...Thirty seconds.\\n\\nCHRISTIE: Yeah, sure. And, I don\\'t disagree with ending Congress\\' retirement program. I\\'m a governor, I don\\'t have a retirement program in my state, and I don\\'t disagree with that. But, here\\'s the news to the American people, he\\'s complaining about the lying and stealing. The lying and stealing has already occurred. The trust fund is filled with IOU\\'s. We can\\'t fix the problem just by ending Congress\\'s retirement, that\\'s worth about, \"this\" much.\\n\\nWe need to go at the fundamental problem, and the fundamental problem is that this system is broken. It has been stolen from. We have been lied to, [timer sounds] and we need a strong leader to tell the truth and fix...\\n\\nWALLACE: ...Alright, this is it. Thirty Seconds, finally.\\n\\nHUCKABEE: Well, you ask about how we fund it. One of the reasons that Social Security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage. The people who get wages is declining dramatically. Most of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and -- and capital gains.\\n\\nThe FairTax transforms the process by which we fund Social Security and Medicare because the money paid in consumption is paid by everybody, including illegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, all the people [timer sounds] that are freeloading off the system now. [applause]\\n\\nThat\\'s why it ought to be a transformed system. [applause]\\n\\nWALLACE: All right. Enough. [applause]\\n\\nMr. Trump.\\n\\nKELLY: [off mike] Sounds like somebody\\'s a little R-rated. [applause]\\n\\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump, you talk a lot about how you are the person on this stage to grow the economy, I want to ask you about your business records. From corporations, Trump corporations, casinos and hotels, have declared bankruptcy four times over the last quarter-century.\\n\\nUNKNOWN: ...In 2011, you told Forbes Magazine this: \"I\\'ve used the laws of the country to my advantage.\" But at the same time, financial experts involved in those bankruptcies say that lenders to your companies lost billions of dollars.\\n\\nQuestion sir, with that record, why should we trust you to run the nation\\'s business?\\n\\nTRUMP: Because I have used the laws of this country just like the greatest people that you read about every day in business have used the laws of this country, the chapter laws, to do a great job for my company, for myself, for my employees, for my family, et cetera.\\n\\nI have never gone bankrupt, by the way. I have never.\\n\\nBut out of hundreds of deals...\\n\\nWALLACE: No, but the concept sir...\\n\\nTRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse me.\\n\\nWALLACE: ... that\\'s your line, but your companies have gone bankrupt.\\n\\nTRUMP: Excuse me, what am I saying? Out of hundreds of deals that I\\'ve done, hundreds, on four occasions I\\'ve taken advantage of the laws of this country, like other people. I\\'m not going to name their names because I\\'m not going to embarrass, but virtually every person that you read about on the front page of the business sections, they\\'ve used the law.\\n\\nThe difference is, when somebody else uses those laws, nobody writes about it. When I use it, they say, \"Trump, Trump, Trump.\" The fact is, I built a net worth of more than $10 billion. I have a great, great company. I employ thousands of people. And I\\'m very proud of the job I did.\\n\\nAgain Chris, hundreds and hundreds of deals. Four times, I\\'ve taken advantage of the laws. And frankly, so has everybody else in my position.\\n\\nWALLACE: Well sir, let\\'s just talk about the latest example...[applause]...which is Trump Entertainment Resorts, which went bankrupt in 2009. In that case alone, lenders to your company lost over $1 billion and more than 1,100 people were laid off.\\n\\nTRUMP: Well, I...\\n\\nWALLACE: Is that the way that you\\'d run the country?\\n\\nTRUMP: Let me just tell you about the lenders. First of all, these lenders aren\\'t babies. These are total killers. These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think, OK? [laughter and applause] You know, I mean you\\'re living in a world of the make-believe, Chris, you want to know the truth. [applause] And I had the good sense to leave Atlantic City, which by the way, Caesars just went bankrupt. Every company, Chris can tell you, every company virtually in Atlantic City went bankrupt. [laughter] Every company.\\n\\nAnd let me just tell you. I had the good sense, and I\\'ve gotten a lot of credit in the financial pages, seven years ago I left Atlantic City before it totally cratered, and I made a lot of money in Atlantic City, and I\\'m very proud of it. I want to tell you that. Very, very proud of it.\\n\\nWALLACE: So...\\n\\nTRUMP: And by the way, this country right now owes $19 trillion. And they need somebody like me to straighten out that mess.[applause]\\n\\nWALLACE: Senator Rubio. Senator Rubio, more than 3,000 people sent us questions about the economy and jobs on Facebook. And here is a video question from Tania Cioloko from Philadelphia. Here she is.[begin video clip]\\n\\nQUESTION: Please describe one action you would do to make the economic environment more favorable for small businesses and entrepreneurs and anyone dreaming of opening their own business.\\n\\n[close video clip]\\n\\nRUBIO: That\\'s a great question.\\n\\nWALLACE: Senator, how do you answer Tania?\\n\\nRUBIO: That\\'s a great question.\\n\\nFirst of all, it begins by having leaders that recognize that the economy we live in today is dramatically different from the one we had five years ago. It\\'s an economy that now has placed us in global competition with dozens of other countries around the world.\\n\\nNow, the big companies that have connections with Washington, they can affect policies to help them, but the small companies like the one Tania is talking about, they\\'re the ones that are struggling.\\n\\nThe first thing we need to do is we need to even out the tax code for small businesses so that we lower their tax rate to 25 percent, just as we need to lower it for all businesses.\\n\\nWe need to have a regulatory budget in America that limits the amount of regulations on our economy. We need to repeal and replace Obamacare and we need to improve higher education so that people can have access to the skills they need for 21st century jobs.\\n\\nAnd last but not least, we need to repeal Dodd-Frank. It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks. [applause] 20 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out over the \\xe2\\x80\\x94 since Dodd-Frank has passed. We need to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank. We need to make America fair again for all businesses, but especially those being run by small business owners.\\n\\nWALLACE: Senator Rubio, thank you. [applause]\\n\\nBAIER: Gentlemen, another question for a few of you.\\n\\nYesterday, just yesterday, President Obama criticized Republican lawmakers trying to block the Iran deal, calling them knee-jerk partisans, adding that hardliners in Iran who chant \"death to America\" were, quote, \"making common cause with the Republican caucus.\"\\n\\nHere\\'s what two of your opponents on the 5 p.m. debate stage said about Iran.\\n\\n[video clip begins]\\n\\nPERRY: I will tell you one thing: I would whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry. Maybe we would\\'ve gotten a deal where we didn\\'t give everything away.\\n\\nBut the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but hell no, to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror...\\n\\n[video clip ends]\\n\\n[video clip begins]\\n\\nFIORINA: When America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place. This is a bad deal. Obama broke every rule of negotiation.\\n\\nYes, our allies are not perfect, but Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxy.\\n\\n[video clip ends]\\n\\nBAIER: Now, I wanna ask a few of you this. First, Governor Walker.\\n\\nYou\\'ve said that you would tear up the Iran deal on day one. If this deal is undone, what then?\\n\\nWALKER: Well, first off, let\\'s remember. I still remember, as a kid, tying a yellow ribbon around a tree in front of my house during the 444 days that Iran held 52 Americans hostage. Iran is not a place we should be doing business with.\\n\\nTo me, you terminate the deal on day one, you reinstate the sanctions authorized by Congress, you go to Congress and put in place even more crippling sanctions in place, and then you convince our allies to do the same.\\n\\nThis is not just bad with Iran, this is bad with ISIS. It is tied together, and, once and for all, we need a leader who\\'s gonna stand up and do something about it.\\n\\nIt\\'s yet another example of the failed foreign policy of the Obama-Clinton doctrine. [applause]\\n\\nBAIER: Senator Paul, would you tear up the deal on day one?\\n\\nPAUL: I oppose the Iranian deal, and will vote against it. I don\\'t think that the president negotiated from a position of strength, but I don\\'t immediately discount negotiations.\\n\\nI\\'m a Reagan conservative. Reagan did negotiate with the Soviets. But you have to negotiate from a position of strength, and I think President Obama gave away too much, too early.\\n\\nIf there\\'s going to be a negotiation, you\\'re going to have to believe somehow that the Iranians are going to comply. And I asked this question to John Kerry, I said \"do you believe they\\'re trustworthy?\" and he said \"No.\"\\n\\nAnd I said, \"well, how are we gonna get them to comply?\" I would have never released the sanctions before there was consistent evidence of compliance.\\n\\nBAIER: Governor Huckabee, what do you think about what Senator Paul just said?\\n\\nHUCKABEE: Ronald Reagan said \"trust, but verify.\" President Obama is \"trust, but vilify.\" He trusts our enemies and vilifies everyone who disagrees with him.\\n\\nAnd the reason we disagree with him has nothing to do with party. [applause]\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\nHUCKABEE: It has to do with the incredibly dangerous place that this world is gonna be as a result of a deal in which we got nothing.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t even get four hostages out. We got nothing, and Iran gets everything they want.\\n\\nWe said we would have anywhere, anytime negotiations and inspections, we gave that up. We said that we would make sure that they didn\\'t have any nuclear capacity, we gave that up.\\n\\nThe president can\\'t tell us what we got. I\\'ll tell you what the world got. The world has a burgeoning nuclear power that didn\\'t, as the Soviets, say \"we might defend ourselves in a war.\"\\n\\nWhat the Iranians have said is, \"we will wipe Israel off the face of the map, and we will bring death to America.\" When someone points a gun at your head [timer sounds] and loads it, by God, you ought to take them seriously, and we need to take that seriously.\\n\\nBAIER: Thank you, gentlemen.\\n\\nKELLY: Well, the first debate night of the 2016 presidential campaign continues from Cleveland after a short time-out. Stick around. Social issues, next.\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\nKELLY: Senator Rubio, you favor a rape and incest exception to abortion bans. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York just said yesterday those exceptions are preposterous. He said they discriminate against an entire class of human beings. If you believe that life begins at conception, as you say you do, how do you justify ending a life just because it begins violently, through no fault of the baby?\\n\\nRUBIO: Well, Megyn, first of all, I\\'m not sure that that\\'s a correct assessment of my record. I would go on to add that I believe all--\\n\\nKELLY: You don\\'t favor a rape and incest exception?\\n\\nRUBIO: I have never said that. And I have never advocated that. What I have advocated is that we pass law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection.\\n\\nIn fact, I think that law already exists. It is called the Constitution of the United States. [applause]\\n\\nAnd let me go further. I believe that every single human being is entitled to the protection of our laws, whether they can vote or not. Whether they can speak or not. Whether they can hire a lawyer or not. Whether they have a birth certificate or not. And I think future generations will look back at this history of our country and call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies who we never gave them a chance to live. [applause]\\n\\nKELLY: Mr. Trump, in 1999, you said you were, quote, \"very pro- choice.\" Even supporting partial-birth abortion. You favored an assault weapons ban as well. In 2004, you said in most cases you identified as a Democrat. Even in this campaign, your critics say you often sound more like a Democrat than a Republican, calling several of your opponents on the stage things like clowns and puppets. When did you actually become a Republican? [ catcalls]\\n\\nTRUMP: I don\\'t think they like me very much. I\\'ll tell you what. I\\'ve evolved on many issues over the years. And you know who else has? Is Ronald Reagan evolved on many issues.\\n\\nAnd I am pro-life. And if you look at the question, I was in business. They asked me a question as to pro-life or choice. And I said if you let it run, that I hate the concept of abortion. I hate the concept of abortion. And then since then, I\\'ve very much evolved.\\n\\nAnd what happened is friends of mine years ago were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted. And it wasn\\'t aborted. And that child today is a total superstar, a great, great child. And I saw that. And I saw other instances.\\n\\nAnd I am very, very proud to say that I am pro-life.\\n\\nAs far as being a Republican is concerned, I come from a place, New York City, which is virtually, I mean, it is almost exclusively Democrat. And I have really started to see some of the negatives -- as an example, and I have a lot of liking for this man, but the last number of months of [timer sounds] his brother\\'s administration were a catastrophe. And unfortunately, those few months gave us President Obama. And you can\\'t be happy about that. [applause]\\n\\nKELLY: Governor Bush, I want to ask you, on the subject of name calling of your fellow candidates, a story appeared today quoting an anonymous GOP donor who said you called Mr. Trump a clown, a buffoon, something else that cannot be repeated on television.\\n\\nBUSH: None of which is true.\\n\\nKELLY: Is it true?\\n\\nBUSH: No. It\\'s not true. But I have said that Mr. Trump\\'s language is divisive.\\n\\nI want to win. I want one of these people here or the ones at 5:00, to be the next president of the United States.\\n\\nWe\\'re not going on win by doing what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton do each and every day. Dividing the country. Saying, creating a grievance kind of environment. We\\'re going to win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message. I have that message because I was a governor of a state that saw people lifted up, because we had high sustained economic growth. Our economy grew at double the rate of the nation. We created 1.3 million jobs. We led the nation seven out of those eight years. We were only one of two states that went to AAA bond rating. I cut taxes, $19 billion. If you do that and apply conservative principles the right way, you create an environment where everybody rises up. That\\'s how we\\'re going to win. Campaigning in places to give people hope that their life is better because too many people are suffering today in America.\\n\\nKELLY: Mr. Trump, 30 seconds.\\n\\nTRUMP: First of all, Jeb, I am very happy that you denied that, and I appreciate that very much. He is a true gentleman. He really is.\\n\\nOne thing he did say, and I mean that. The one thing he did say about me, however, was my tone. And I also understand that. But when you have people that are cutting Christians\\' heads off, when you have a world that the border and at so many places, that it is medieval times, we\\'ve never -- it almost has to be as bad as it ever was in terms of the violence and the horror, we don\\'t have time for tone. [timer sounds] We have to go out and get the job done. [applause]\\n\\nKELLY: The subject of gay marriage and religious liberty. Governor Kasich, if you had a son or daughter who was gay or lesbian, how would you explain to them your opposition to same-sex marriage?\\n\\nKASICH: Well, look, I\\'m an old-fashioned person here, and I happen to believe in traditional marriage. But I\\'ve also said the court has ruled --\\n\\nKELLY: How would you -- how would you explain it to a child?\\n\\nKASICH: Wait, Megyn, the court has ruled, and I said we\\'ll accept it. And guess what, I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay. Because somebody doesn\\'t think the way I do, doesn\\'t mean that I can\\'t care about them or can\\'t love them. So if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them. Because you know what? [applause]\\n\\nThat\\'s what we\\'re taught when we have strong faith. [applause]\\n\\nSo the issues like that, issues like that are planted to divide us. I think the simple fact of the matter is, and this is where I would agree with Jeb, and I\\'ve been saying it all along, we need to give everybody a chance, treat everybody with respect, and let them share in this great American dream that we have, Megan. So, look, I\\'m going to love my daughters, I\\'m going to love them no matter what they do. Because, you know what, [timer sounds] God gives me unconditional love. I\\'m going to give it to my family and my friends and the people around me.\\n\\nKELLY: Senator Paul, in the wake of the Supreme Court\\'s ruling on same sex marriage, Carol Fox on Facebook want to know the following. Quote: what will you do to ensure Christians are not prosecuted for speaking out against gay marriage and will Christians be forced to conduct business that conflicts with their religious beliefs?\\n\\nPAUL: Look, I don\\'t want my marriage or my guns registered in Washington. And if people have an opinion, it\\'s a religious opinion that is heartly felt, obviously they should be allowed to practice that and no government should interfere with them. One of the things, one of the things that really got to me was the thing in Houston where you had the government, the mayor actually, trying to get the sermons of ministers. When the government tries to invade the church to enforce its own opinion on marriage, that\\'s when it\\'s time to resist.\\n\\nKELLY: Governor Walker, many in the Black Lives Matter movement, and beyond, believe that overly-aggressive police officers targeting young African Americans is the civil rights issue of our time. Do you agree? And if so, how do you plan to address it? And if not, why not?\\n\\nWALKER: Well, I think the most important thing we can do when it comes to policing -- it\\'s something you\\'ve had a guest on who\\'s a friend of mine Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clark, who\\'s talked to me about this many times in the past -- it\\'s about training. It\\'s about making sure that law enforcement professionals, not only in the way in to their positions but all the way through their time, have the proper training, particularly when it comes to the use of force. And that we protect and stand up and support those men and women who are doing their jobs in law enforcement. And for the very few that don\\'t, that there are consequences to show that we treat everyone the same here in America.\\n\\nKELLY: Thank you.\\n\\nMODERATOR: Coming up more of our debate, including questions about President Obama\\'s foreign policy and these guys and their better ideas. Coming up.\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\nBAIER: Welcome back to Cleveland. Our next topic is foreign policy. Candidates, you may not have seen the late developing news today our Fox Pentagon team broke earlier this evening about a top Iranian general traveling to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\\n\\nHis name is General Qassem Soleimani, he\\'s blamed for hundreds of U.S. troop\\'s deaths in Iraq, and Afghanistan. His trip to Russia appears to directly violate U.N. Security Council resolutions to confine him to Iran.\\n\\nSo, Mr. Trump, if you were president, how would you respond to this?\\n\\nTRUMP: I would be so different from what you have right now. Like, the polar opposite. We have a president who doesn\\'t have a clue. I would say he\\'s incompetent, but I don\\'t want to do that because that\\'s not nice. [laughter]\\n\\nBut if you look at the deals we make, whether it\\'s the nuclear deal with 24 hour periods -- and by the way, before you get to the 24 hours, you have to go through a system. You look at Sgt. Bergdahl, we get Bergdahl, a traitor, and they get five of the big, great killers leaders that they want. We have people in Washington that don\\'t know what they\\'re doing. Now... [applause; scream from audience]\\n\\nI agree. [applause]\\n\\nNow, with Iran, we\\'re making a deal, you would say, we want him. We want out our prisoners. We want all these things, and we don\\'t get anything. We\\'re giving them $150 billion dollars plus, they are going to be -- I\\'ll tell you what, if Iran was a stock, you folks should go out and buy it right now because you\\'ll quadruple -- this, what\\'s happening [timer sounds] in Iran, is a disgrace, and it\\'s going to lead to destruction in large portions of the world. [applause]\\n\\nBAIER: Another new development today, Senior Defense officials tell Fox they strongly suspect Russia was behind the cyber attack on the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs office...\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: ...Please.\\n\\nBAIER: ...email. This comes in the wake of the Director of National Intelligence blaming the Chinese for the largest ever cyber attack, stealing personal data of tens of millions of Americans.\\n\\nSenator Cruz, in your view, have Russia and China committed acts of cyber war, and if you were president, what would you do about it?\\n\\nCRUZ: Well, Bret, of course they have, and over the last six and a half years we\\'ve seen the consequences of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy. Leading from behind is a disaster. We have abandoned and alienated our friends and allies, and our enemies are stronger. Radical Islam is on the rise, Iran\\'s on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon, China is waging cyber warfare against America, Russia -- General Soleimani, you just mentioned, the Iranian general is the head of the al Quds forces.\\n\\nHe\\'s directly responsible for the murder of over 500 American servicemen in Iraq, and part of this Iranian deal was lifting the international sanctions on General Soleimani. The day General Soleimani flew back from Moscow to Iran was the day we believed that Russia used cyber warfare against the Joint Chiefs. We need a new commander in chief that will stand up to our enemies, and that will have credibility... [applause]\\n\\nIt is worth emphasizing that Iran released our hostages in 1981 the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. [applause]\\n\\nBAIER: Dr. Carson, in August of 2012 President Obama famously declared Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons, quote, \"that\\'s a redline for us,\" and that there would be enormous consequences.\\n\\nOne year later, with overwhelming evidence the Assad had, in fact, used chemical weapons and crossed that red line, President Obama declined to use military force against the Assad regime.\\n\\nAs president, would you have used military force there?\\n\\nCARSON: Well, what we have to stop and think about is that we have weakened ourselves militarily to such an extent that if affects all of our military policies. Our Navy is at its smallest size since 1917; our Air Force, since 1940. In recent testimony, the commandant of the Marine Corps said half of the non-deployed units were not ready and you know, the sequester is cutting the heart out of our personnel. Our generals are retiring because they don\\'t want to be part of this, and at the same time, our enemies are increasing.\\n\\nOur -- our friends can\\'t trust us anymore. You know, Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state. They gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them. We won\\'t even give them offensive weapons.\\n\\nYou know, we turned our back on Israel, our ally. You know, in a situation like that, of course Obama\\'s not going to be able to do anything. I would shore up our military first, because if you don\\'t get the military right, nothing else is going to work. [applause]\\n\\nBAIER: Governor Walker, as president, what would you do if Russian President Vladimir Putin started a campaign to destabilize NATO allies Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, mirroring the actions Putin took at the early days of Ukraine?\\n\\nWALKER: Well first off, for the cyber attack with Russia the other day, it\\'s sad to think right now, but probably the Russian and Chinese government know more about Hillary Clinton\\'s e-mail server than do the members of the United States Congress. [laughter and applause]\\n\\nAnd -- and that has put our national security at risk. If I am president, he won\\'t think about that. You know, Putin believes in the old Lenin adage: you probe with bayonets. When you find mush, you push. When you find steel, you stop.\\n\\nUnder Obama and Clinton, we found a lot of mush over the last two years. We need to have a national security that puts steel in front of our enemies. I would send weapons to Ukraine. I would work with NATO to put forces on the eastern border of Poland and the Baltic nations, and I would reinstate, put in place back in the missile defense system that we had in Poland and in the Czech Republic. [applause]\\n\\nWe find steel.\\n\\nBAIER: Governor -- Governor Huckabee, the culture of the American military is definitely changing. Women are moving into combat roles. Don\\'t Ask, Don\\'t Tell has obviously been dropped. And now Defense Secretary Ashton Carter recently directed the military to prepare for a moment when it is welcoming transgender persons to serve openly.\\n\\nAs commander in chief, how would you handle that?\\n\\nHUCKABEE: The military is not a social experiment. The purpose of the military is kill people and break things. [applause]\\n\\nIt\\'s not to transform the culture by trying out some ideas that some people think would make us a different country and more diverse. The purpose is to protect America. I\\'m not sure how paying for transgender surgery for soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines makes our country safer.\\n\\nWe\\'ve reduced the military by 25 percent... [applause] ... under President Obama. The disaster is that we\\'ve forgotten why we have a military. The purpose of it is to make sure that we protect every American, wherever that American is, and if an American is calling out for help, whether it\\'s in Benghazi or at the border, then we ought to be able to answer it.\\n\\nWe\\'ve not done that because we\\'ve decimated our military. We\\'re flying B-52s. The most recent one that was put in service was November of 1962. A lot of the B-52s we\\'re flying, we\\'ve only got 44 that are in service combat ready, and the fact is, most of them are older than me. And that\\'s pretty scary.\\n\\n[laughter and applause]\\n\\nBAIER: Senator Paul, the first budget you proposed as senator cut all financial aid to Israel. You have since changed your view on that issue. What made you change your mind.\\n\\nPAUL: Well, let\\'s be clear, I\\'m the only one on the stage who actually has a five-year budget that balances. I\\'ve put pencil to paper...\\n\\nUNKNOWN: I do.\\n\\nPAUL: ... and I\\'ve said -- and I\\'ve said I would cut spending, and I\\'ve said exactly where. Each one of my budgets has taken a meat axe to foreign aid, because I think we ought to quit sending it to countries that hate us. [applause]\\n\\nI think we ought to quit sending it to countries that burn our flag. Israel is not one of those. But even Benjamin Netanyahu said that ultimately, they will be stronger when they\\'re independent. My position is exactly the same.\\n\\nWe shouldn\\'t borrow money from China to send it anywhere, but why don\\'t we start with eliminating aid to our enemies.\\n\\nBAIER: OK. But you still say that Israel could be one of the countries that is cut from financial aid?\\n\\nPAUL: I still say exactly what my original opinion is. Do you borrow money from China to send it to anyone? Out of your surplus, you can help your allies, and Israel is a great ally. And this is no particular animus of Israel, but what I will say, and I will say over and over again, we cannot give away money we don\\'t have.\\n\\nWe do not project power from bankruptcy court. We\\'re borrowing a million dollars a minute. [applause]\\n\\nIt\\'s got to stop somewhere.\\n\\nBAIER: Governor Christie, what do you think of that answer?\\n\\nCHRISTIE: Well, listen.\\n\\nYou know, if we want to deal with these issues, we have to deal with them in a way that makes sense.\\n\\nI agree with what Dr. Carson said earlier. The first thing we need to do to make America stronger is to strengthen our military, and I put out a really specific plan: no less than 500,000 active duty soldiers in the Army. No less than 185,000 active duty marines in the Marine Corps. Bring us to a 350 ship Navy again, and modernize the Ohio class of submarines, and bring our Air Force back to 2,600 aircraft that are ready to go.\\n\\nThose are the kind of things that are going to send a clear message around the world. Those are the things that we need to start working on immediately to make our country stronger and make it better. Those are the things that we need to be able to be doing. And as we move towards dealing with foreign aid, I don\\'t disagree with Senator Paul\\'s position that we shouldn\\'t be funding our enemies. But I absolutely believe that Israel is a priority to be able to fund and keep them strong and safe after eight years of this administration. [applause]\\n\\nBAIER: Governor, thank you.\\n\\nCRUZ: Brett, can I -- Brett, can I jump in on this one?\\n\\nBAIER: Senator, we\\'re going to finish up with some more questions, thank you.\\n\\nKELLY: We have to stand you by, because after the break, we\\'re going to let the candidates make their closing statements, their final thoughts, and . . . God.\\n\\nStay tuned for that.\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\nKELLY: Welcome back.\\n\\nIn our final moments here together, we\\'re going to allow the candidates to offer their final thoughts. But first, we want to ask them an interesting closing question from Chase Norton on Facebook, who wants to know this of the candidates: \"I want to know if any of them have received a word from God on what they should do and take care of first.\"\\n\\nSenator Cruz, start from you. Any word from God?\\n\\nCRUZ: Well, I am blessed to receive a word from God every day in receiving the scriptures and reading the scriptures. And God speaks through the Bible. [applause]\\n\\nI\\'m the son of a pastor and evangelist and I\\'ve described many times how my father, when I was a child, was an alcoholic. He wasn\\'t a Christian. And my father left my mother and left me when I was just three years old.\\n\\nAnd someone invited him to Clay Road Baptist Church. And he gave his heart to Jesus and it turned him around. And he got on a plane and he flew back to my mother and me. [applause]\\n\\nI would also note that the scripture tells us, \"you shall know them by their fruit.\" We see lots of \"campaign conservatives.\" But if we\\'re going to win in 2016, we need a consistent conservative, someone who has been a fiscal conservative, a social conservative, a national security conservative.\\n\\nThere are real differences among the candidates on issues like amnesty, like Obamacare, like religious liberty, like life and marriage. And I have been proud to fight and stand for religious liberty, to stand against Planned Parenthood, to defend life for my entire career.\\n\\nAnd I will be proud to continue to do so as president of the United States.\\n\\n[cheering and applause]\\n\\nKELLY: Governor Kasich, same question.\\n\\nKASICH: Well, Megyn, my father was a mailman. His father was a coal miner. My mother\\'s mother could barely speak English. And their son today stands on this podium in the great state of Ohio not only as the governor, but a candidate for president of the United States. [cheering and applause]\\n\\nI do believe in miracles. You know, I\\'ve had a lot of elections. But my elections are really not about campaigns. I tell my people that these are about a movement. And a movement to do what? To restore common sense. A movement to do things like provide economic growth. And a movement not to let anybody be behind.\\n\\nYou know, today the country is divided. You asked a question about the police and the difficulty in communities. We\\'ve got to unite our country again, because we\\'re stronger when we are united and we are weaker when we are divided.\\n\\nAnd we\\'ve got to listen to other people\\'s voices, respect them, but keep in mind, and I believe in terms of the things that I\\'ve read in my lifetime, the Lord\\'is not picking us. But because of how we respect human rights, because that we are a good force in the world, he wants America to be strong.\\n\\nHe wants America to succeed. And he wants America to lead. And nothing is more important to me than my family, my faith, and my friends. [cheering and applause]\\n\\nKELLY: Governor Walker, same question.\\n\\nWALKER: Well, thanks, Megyn.\\n\\nI\\'m certainly an imperfect man. And it\\'s only by the blood of Jesus Christ that I\\'ve been redeemed from my sins. So I know that God doesn\\'t call me to do a specific thing, God hasn\\'t given me a list, a Ten Commandments, if you will, of things to act on the first day.\\n\\nWhat God calls us to do is follow his will. And ultimately that\\'s what I\\'m going to try to do. And I hope people\\'ve seen it in my state, even in the big challenges I took on when I had over 100,000 protesters in and around our capital, trying to do what I thought was the right thing.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t just how I took on those political battles. It was ultimately how I acted. Not responding in kind. Not lashing out. But just being decent going forward and living my life in a way that would be a testimony to him and our faith. [applause]\\n\\nKELLY: Senator Rubio, I want to ask you the same question. But I do want to mention, a woman just came here to the stage and asked, what about the veterans? I want to hear more about what these candidates are going to do for our nation\\'s veterans.\\n\\nSo I put the question to you about God and the veterans, which you may find to be related.\\n\\nRUBIO: Well, first, let me say I think God has blessed us. He has blessed the Republican Party with some very good candidates. The Democrats can\\'t even find one. [laughter] [cheering and applause]\\n\\nAnd I believe God has blessed our country. This country has been extraordinarily blessed. And we have honored that blessing. And that\\'s why God has continued to bless us.\\n\\nAnd he has blessed us with young men and women willing to risk their lives and sometimes die in uniform for the safety and security of our people.\\n\\nUnfortunately today we have a VA that does not do enough for them. I am proud that last year we helped change the law. We changed the law to give the power to the VA secretary the ability to fire any executive that isn\\'t doing their job.\\n\\nAnd it is outrageous they\\'ve only fired one person to date. When I\\'m president of the United States, we\\'re going to have a VA that cares more about our veterans than about the bureaucrats who work at the VA. [cheering and applause]\\n\\nKELLY: Dr. Carson, a question to you about God and his role, but also, one of the issues that the public was very interested in, and we touched on it earlier, is race relations in this country, and how divided we seem right now. And what, if anything, you can do -- you would do as the next president to help heal that divide.\\n\\nCARSON: Well, I think the bully pulpit is a wonderful place to start healing that divide. You know, we have the purveyors of hatred who take every single incident between people of two races and try to make a race war out of it, and drive wedges into people. And this does not need to be done.\\n\\nWhat we need to think about instead -- you know, I was asked by an NPR reporter once, why don\\'t I talk about race that often. I said it\\'s because I\\'m a neurosurgeon. And she thought that was a strange response. And you say -- I said, you see, when I take someone to the operating room, I\\'m actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are. The skin doesn\\'t make them who they are. The hair doesn\\'t make them who they are. And it\\'s time for us to move beyond that. [applause]\\n\\nBecause...[applause]...our strength as a nation comes in our unity. We are the United States of America, not the divided states. And those who want to destroy us are trying to divide us, and we shouldn\\'t let them do it. [applause]\\n\\nBAIER: Now each candidate will make a closing statement. You\\'ll all have 30 seconds to make a closing statement for this debate. We\\'ll start with Ohio Governor John Kasich.\\n\\nKASICH: You know, tonight we hear about what people want to do. I want to tell you what I\\'ve done. I was a member of the Armed Services Committee for 18 years. I spent a big chunk of my life studying national security issues and our role in the world.\\n\\nNo. 2. I was the chairman of the House Budget Committee and one of the chief architects the last time we balanced a budget, and it was the first time we had done it since man walked on the moon. We had a $5 trillion surplus and we cut taxes.\\n\\nI spent ten years in the private sector, actually learning how business works. And now I\\'m the governor of Ohio, and I inherited a state that was on the brink [timer sounds] of dying. And we turned it all around with jobs and balanced budgets and rising credit and tax cuts, and the state is unified, and people have hope again in Ohio. [applause]\\n\\nKELLY: Governor Christie?\\n\\nCHRISTIE: Well, thank you, Megyn. Listen, I was born into a middle class family in New Jersey. My dad came home from serving in the Army after having lost his father, worked in the Breyers ice cream plant in Newark, New Jersey. Was the first person to graduate from college. He put himself through college at night. My mom was a secretary.\\n\\nI was appointed United States attorney on September 10, 2001. And I spent the next seven years of my career fighting terrorism and putting terrorists in jail.\\n\\nI\\'m a conservative, pro-life governor in a state where it is really tough to be both. A state like New Jersey, with lots of Democrats, but still we cut taxes, we balanced budgets. We fought [timer sounds] the teacher\\'s union.\\n\\nThis president has had weak leadership, which has led to bad choices. We have got to stop worrying about being loved and start worrying about being respected. And that\\'s exactly how I\\'ll lead our country. [applause]\\n\\nWALLACE: Senator Paul, closing statement.\\n\\nPAUL: I\\'m a different kind of Republican. I\\'ve introduced a five-year balanced budget. I\\'ve introduced the largest tax cut in our history. I stood for ten and a half hours on the Senate floor to defend your right to be left alone. [applause]\\n\\nBut I\\'ve also gone to Chicago. I\\'ve gone to Detroit. I\\'ve been to Ferguson, I\\'ve been to Baltimore, because I want our party to be bigger, better and bolder, and I\\'m the only one that leads Hillary Clinton in five states that were won by President Obama. I\\'m a different kind of Republican. [applause]\\n\\nBAIER: Senator Marco Rubio.\\n\\nRUBIO: Thank you. You know, both of my parents were born into poor families on the island of Cuba. They came to America because it was the only place where people like them could have a chance. Here in this country, they never made it big, but the very purpose of their life was to give us the chance to do all the things they never could.\\n\\nMy father was a bartender. And the journey from the back of that bar to this stage tonight, to me, that is the essence of the American dream. It is what makes our nation different. And I\\'m running for president because I want that to still be possible for the people trying to do that now. I run for president because I believe that we can\\'t just save the American dream; we can expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And that\\'s why I\\'m asking for your vote. So we can make America greater than it has ever been. And make of this century a new American century. [applause]\\n\\nBAIER: Thank you, Senator.\\n\\nKELLY: Senator Ted Cruz.\\n\\nCRUZ: If I\\'m elected president, let me tell you about my first day in office. The first thing I intend to do is to rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama. [applause]\\n\\nThe next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into these videos and to prosecute Planned Parenthood for any criminal violations. [applause]\\n\\nThe next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice and the IRS to start (sic) persecuting religious liberty, and then intend to cancel the Iran deal, and finally move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. [applause]\\n\\nI will keep my word. My father fled Cuba, and I will fight to defend liberty because my family knows what it\\'s like to lose it.\\n\\nWALLACE: Dr. Carson, closing statement.\\n\\nCARSON: Well, I haven\\'t said anything about me being the only one to do anything, so let me try that.\\n\\nI\\'m the only one to separate Siamese twins...[laughter]\\n\\nThe -- the only one to operate on babies while they were still in mother\\'s womb, the only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it. [laughter]\\n\\nBut I -- but I\\'m very hopeful that I\\'m not the only one who\\'s willing to pick up the baton of freedom, because freedom is not free, and we must fight for it every day. Every one of us must fight for it, because we\\'re fighting for our children and the next generation. [applause]\\n\\nBAIER: Governor Mike Huckabee, closing statement.\\n\\nHUCKABEE: It seems like this election has been a whole lot about a person who\\'s very high in the polls, that doesn\\'t have a clue about how to govern.\\n\\nA person who has been filled with scandals, and who could not lead, and, of course, I\\'m talking about Hillary Clinton. [laughter]\\n\\nI think America...\\n\\nUNKNOWN: Thank you.\\n\\nHUCKABEE: ...is in trouble, but it\\'s not beyond repair. But it\\'s going to take leadership who sees the greatness of this country, and who believes that once again we can be one nation, under God.\\n\\nI\\'ll be my best to do that, and thank you for your support. [applause]\\n\\nKELLY: Governor Scott Walker.\\n\\nWALKER: Thanks.\\n\\nI\\'m guy with a wife and two kids, and Harley. One article called me \"aggressively normal.\"\\n\\nI ran for governor because I was worried about my kids\\' future. Then, I took on the big government union bosses, and we won. They tried to recall me, and we won. They target us again, and we won.\\n\\nWe balanced the budget, cut taxes, and turned our state around with big, bold reforms.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t too late for Wisconsin, and it\\'s not too late for America. That\\'s why I ask for your vote.\\n\\nWALLACE: Governor Bush, closing statement, sir.\\n\\nBUSH: Here\\'s what I believe. I believe we\\'re at the verge of the greatest time to be alive in this world.\\n\\nBut Washington is holding us back. How we tax, how we regulate. We\\'re not embracing the energy revolution in our midst, a broken immigration system that has been politicized rather than turning it into an economic driver.\\n\\nWe\\'re not protecting and preserving our entitlement system or reforming for the next generation. All these things languish while we have politicians in Washington using these as wedge issues.\\n\\nHere\\'s my commitment to you, because I did it as Florida. We can fix these things. We can grow economically and restore America\\'s leadership in the world, so that everybody has a chance to rise up. I humbly ask for your vote, whenever you\\'re gonna get to vote, whenever the primary is. Thank you all very much.\\n\\nBAIER: Mr. Trump, closing statement, sir.\\n\\nTRUMP: Our country is in serious trouble. We don\\'t win anymore.\\n\\nWe don\\'t beat China in trade. We don\\'t beat Japan, with their millions and millions of cars coming into this country, in trade. We can\\'t beat Mexico, at the border or in trade.\\n\\nWe can\\'t do anything right. Our military has to be strengthened. Our vets have to be taken care of. We have to end Obamacare, and we have to make our country great again, and I will do that.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nBAIER: Gentlemen, thank you.\\n\\nKELLY: It\\'s over!\\n\\nBAIER: That\\'s it.\\n\\nKELLY: Are you relieved? You were nervous before, they -- they don\\'t look relieved. They look \"get me outta here.\"\\n\\nThank you all very much, and that will do it for the first Republican primary debate night of the 2016 presidential race. Our thanks to the candidates, who will now be joined by their families on stage.']"

       "{'BAIER': [u\"Less than a year from now, in this very arena, one of these 10 candidates or one of the seven on the previous debate tonight will accept the Republican party's nomination. Tonight's candidates were selected based on an average of five national polls. Just a few hours ago, you heard from the candidates ranked 11th through 17. And now, the prime-time event, the top 10.\",\n",
       "  u'Neurosurgeon, Dr. Ben Carson. Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Florida Senator Marco Rubio.',\n",
       "  u\"It might be. It might be. We'll see.\",\n",
       "  u\"It might be. The rules for tonight are simple. One minute for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups. And if a candidate runs over, you'll hear this. Pleasant, no? We also have a big crowd here with us tonight in the home of the Cavaliers, as I mentioned. And while we expect them...we expect them to be enthusiastic, as you heard, we don't want to take anything away from the valuable time for the candidate. So, we're looking for somewhere between a reaction to a LeBron James dunk and the Cleveland Public Library across the street. Somewhere there, we'll find a balance tonight. Without further ado, let's begin.\",\n",
       "  u\"Gentlemen, we know how much you love hand-raising questions. So we promise, this is the only one tonight: the only one. Is there anyone on stage, and can I see hands, who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person. Again, we're looking for you to raise your hand now -- raise your hand now if you won't make that pledge tonight. Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump to be clear, you're standing on a Republican primary debate stage.\",\n",
       "  u'The place where the RNC will give the nominee the nod.',\n",

       "  u'OK. Alright.',\n",
       "  u'Governor Bush, you have insisted that you\\'re your own man. You say you have a life experience uniquely your own. Not your father\\'s, not your brother\\'s. But there are several opponents on this stage who get big- applause lines in early voting states with this line: quote, \"the last thing the country needs is another Bush in the Oval Office.\" So do you understand the real concern in this country about dynastic politics?',\n",
       "  u\"Governor Christie, you're not exactly the darling of conservatives. You tout your record as a Republican governor in a blue state. On Facebook, the most people talking about you, not surprisingly, come from your state of New Jersey, and one of the top issues they are talking about is the economy. This -- this may be why. Under your watch, New Jersey has undergone nine credit rating downgrades. The state's 44th in private sector growth. You face an employee pension crisis and the Garden State has the third highest foreclosure rate in the country. So why should voters believe that your management of the country's finances would be any different?\",\n",

But, the statement went on, and you said, quote, \"Everything they\\'ve talked about in foreign policy, they\\'ve been wrong for the last 20 years.\" Why are you so quick to blame your own party?',\n",

Use -- you\\'ve also donated to several Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton included, Nancy Pelosi. You explained away those donations saying you did that to get business-related favors. And you said recently, quote, \"When you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.\"',\n",

       "  u'Many questions to come. Governor Huckabee, on Facebook, John Pietricone asked this, \"Will you abolish or take away the powers and cut the size of the EPA, the IRS, the Department of Education?\" Now, broadly...broadly, the size of government is a big concern for Facebook users, Facebook persons, as well as, obviously, conservatives. But year after year, decade after decade, there are promises from Republicans to shrink government. But year after year, decade after decade, it doesn\\'t happen. In fact, it gets bigger, even under Republican politicians. So the question is, at this point, is the government simply too big for any one person, even a Republican, to shrink?',\n",

A lot of people on this stage vigorously oppose a federal involvement in education. They say it should all be handled locally. President Obama\\'s secretary of education, Arnie Duncan, has said that most of the criticism of Common Core is due to a, quote, \"fringe group of critics.\" Do you think that\\'s accurate?',\n",

       "  u'Gentlemen, another question for a few of you. Yesterday, just yesterday, President Obama criticized Republican lawmakers trying to block the Iran deal, calling them knee-jerk partisans, adding that hardliners in Iran who chant \"death to America\" were, quote, \"making common cause with the Republican caucus.\" Here\\'s what two of your opponents on the 5 p.m. debate stage said about Iran.',\n",
       "  u\"Now, I wanna ask a few of you this. First, Governor Walker. You've said that you would tear up the Iran deal on day one. If this deal is undone, what then?\",\n",

       "  u\"Welcome back to Cleveland. Our next topic is foreign policy. Candidates, you may not have seen the late developing news today our Fox Pentagon team broke earlier this evening about a top Iranian general traveling to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. His name is General Qassem Soleimani, he's blamed for hundreds of U.S. troop's deaths in Iraq, and Afghanistan. His trip to Russia appears to directly violate U.N. Security Council resolutions to confine him to Iran. So, Mr. Trump, if you were president, how would you respond to this?\",\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  u'...email. This comes in the wake of the Director of National Intelligence blaming the Chinese for the largest ever cyber attack, stealing personal data of tens of millions of Americans. Senator Cruz, in your view, have Russia and China committed acts of cyber war, and if you were president, what would you do about it?',\n",
       "  u'Dr. Carson, in August of 2012 President Obama famously declared Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons, quote, \"that\\'s a redline for us,\" and that there would be enormous consequences. One year later, with overwhelming evidence the Assad had, in fact, used chemical weapons and crossed that red line, President Obama declined to use military force against the Assad regime. As president, would you have used military force there?',\n",
       "  u'Governor Walker, as president, what would you do if Russian President Vladimir Putin started a campaign to destabilize NATO allies Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, mirroring the actions Putin took at the early days of Ukraine?',\n",
       "  u\"Governor -- Governor Huckabee, the culture of the American military is definitely changing. Women are moving into combat roles. Don't Ask, Don't Tell has obviously been dropped. And now Defense Secretary Ashton Carter recently directed the military to prepare for a moment when it is welcoming transgender persons to serve openly. As commander in chief, how would you handle that?\",\n",
       "  u'Senator Paul, the first budget you proposed as senator cut all financial aid to Israel. You have since changed your view on that issue. What made you change your mind.',\n",
       "  u'OK. But you still say that Israel could be one of the countries that is cut from financial aid?',\n",

       " 'BUSH': [u\"Absolutely, I do, and I'm gonna run hard, run with heart, and run to win. I'm gonna have to earn this. Maybe the barrier -- the bar's even higher for me. That's fine. I've got a record in Florida. I'm proud of my dad, and I'm certainly proud of my brother. In Florida, they called me Jeb, because I earned it. I cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion. We were -- we had -- we balanced every budget. We went from $1 billion of reserves to $9 billion of reserves. We were one of two states that went to AAA bond rating. They keep -- they called me Veto Corleone. Because I vetoed 2,500 separate line-items in the budget. I am my own man. I governed as a conservative, and I govern effectively. And the net effect was, during my eight years, 1.3 million jobs were created. We left the state better off because I applied conservative principles in a purple state the right way, and people rose up.\",\n",
       "  u\"I do. I believe that the great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option. They want to provide for their family. But we need to control our border. It's not -- it's our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in. So I -- I've written a book about this and yet this week, I did come up with a comprehensive strategy that -- that really mirrored what we said in the book, which is that we need to deal with E-Verify, we need to deal with people that come with a legal visa and overstay. We need to be much more strategic on how we deal with border enforcement, border security. We need to eliminate the sanctuary cities in this country. It is ridiculous and tragic...that people are dying because of the fact that -- that local governments are not following the federal law. There's much to do. And I think rather than talking about this as a wedge issue, which Barack Obama has done now for six long years, the next president -- and I hope to be that president -- will fix this once and for all so that we can turn this into a driver for high sustained economic growth. And there should be a path to earned legal status...for those that are here. Not -- not amnesty, earned legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time.\",\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  u'...I remember, Megyn.',\n",
       "  u\"Knowing what we know now, with faulty intelligence, and not having security be the first priority when -- when we invaded, it was a mistake. I wouldn't have gone in, however, for the people that did lose their lives, and the families that suffer because of it -- I know this full well because as governor of the state of Florida, I called every one of them. Every one of them that I could find to tell them that I was praying for them, that I cared about them, and it was really hard to do. And, every one of them said that their child did not die in vain, or their wife, of their husband did not die in vain. So, why it was difficult for me to do it was based on that. Here's the lesson that we should take from this, which relates to this whole subject. Barack Obama became president, and he abandoned Iraq. He left, and when he left Al Qaida was done for. ISIS was created because of the void that we left, and that void now exists as a caliphate the size of Indiana. To honor the people that died, we need to -- we need to --- stop the -- Iran agreement, for sure, because the Iranian mullahs have their blood on their hands, and we need to take out ISIS with every tool at our disposal.\",\n",
       "  u\"No, I don't. And I don't believe the federal government should be involved in the creation of standards directly or indirectly, the creation of curriculum or content. It is clearly a state responsibility. I'm for higher standards...measured in an intellectually honest way, with abundant school choice, ending social promotion. And I know how to do this because as governor of the state of Florida I created the first statewide voucher program in the country, the second statewide voucher program, in the country and the third statewide voucher program in the country. And we had rising student achievement across the board, because high standards, robust accountability, ending social promotion in third grade, real school choice across the board, challenging the teachers union and beating them is the way to go. And Florida's low income kids had the greatest gains inside the country. Our graduation rate improved by 50 percent. That's what I'm for.\",\n",
       "  u\"He is definitely my friend. And I think the states ought to create these standards. And if states want to opt out of Common Core, fine. Just make sure your standards are high. Because today in America, a third of our kids, after we spend more per student than any country in the world other than a couple rounding errors, to be honest with you, 30 percent are college- and/or career-ready. If we are going to compete in this world we're in today, there is no possible way we can do it with lowering expectations and dumbing down everything. Children are going to suffer and families' hearts are going to be broken that their kids won't be able to get a job in the 21st Century.\",\n",
       "  u\"We've done it 27 times since World War II. I think we need to lift our spirits and have high, lofty expectations for this great country of ours. The new normal of two percent that the left is saying you can't do anything about is so dangerous for our country. There's 6 million people living in poverty today, more than when Barack Obama got elected. 6.5 million people are working part-time, most of whom want to work full-time. We've created rules and taxes on top of every aspiration of people, and the net result is we're not growing fast, income's not growing. A four percent growth strategy means you fix a convoluted tax code. You get in and you change every aspect of regulations that are job killers. You get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something that doesn't suppress wages and kill jobs. You embrace the energy revolution in our country. This president and Hillary Clinton, who can't even say she's for the XL pipeline even after she's left? Give me a break. Of course we're for it. We should be for these things to create high sustained economic growth. And frankly, fixing our immigration system and turning it into an economic driver is part of this as well. We can do this.\",\n",
       "  u'None of which is true.',\n",
       "  u\"No. It's not true. But I have said that Mr. Trump's language is divisive. I want to win. I want one of these people here or the ones at 5:00, to be the next president of the United States. We're not going on win by doing what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton do each and every day. Dividing the country. Saying, creating a grievance kind of environment. We're going to win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message. I have that message because I was a governor of a state that saw people lifted up, because we had high sustained economic growth. Our economy grew at double the rate of the nation. We created 1.3 million jobs. We led the nation seven out of those eight years. We were only one of two states that went to AAA bond rating. I cut taxes, $19 billion. If you do that and apply conservative principles the right way, you create an environment where everybody rises up. That's how we're going to win. Campaigning in places to give people hope that their life is better because too many people are suffering today in America.\",\n",
       "  u\"Here's what I believe. I believe we're at the verge of the greatest time to be alive in this world. But Washington is holding us back. How we tax, how we regulate. We're not embracing the energy revolution in our midst, a broken immigration system that has been politicized rather than turning it into an economic driver. We're not protecting and preserving our entitlement system or reforming for the next generation. All these things languish while we have politicians in Washington using these as wedge issues. Here's my commitment to you, because I did it as Florida. We can fix these things. We can grow economically and restore America's leadership in the world, so that everybody has a chance to rise up. I humbly ask for your vote, whenever you're gonna get to vote, whenever the primary is. Thank you all very much.\"],\n",
       " 'CARSON': [u\"Well, I could take issue with -- with all of those things, but we don't have time. But I will say, we have a debate here tonight, and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas, and I'm looking very much forward to demonstrating that, in fact, the thing that is probably most important is having a brain, and to be able to figure things out and learn things very rapidly. So, you know, experience comes from a large number of different arenas, and America became a great nation early on not because it was flooded with politicians, but because it was flooded with people who understood the value of personal responsibility, hard work, creativity, innovation, and that's what will get us on the right track now, as well.\",\n",
       "  u\"Well, thank you, Megyn, I wasn't sure I was going to get to talk again.\",\n",
       "  u\"Alright. You know, what we do in order to get the information that we need is our business, and I wouldn't necessarily be broadcasting what we're going to do. We. . .uh. . .we've gotten into this -- this mindset of fighting politically correct wars. There is no such thing as a politically correct war. And, the left, of course, will say Carson doesn't believe in the Geneva Convention. Carson doesn't believe in fighting stupid wars. And -- and what we have to remember is we want to utilize the tremendous intellect that we have in the military to win wars. And I've talked to a lot of the generals, a lot of our advanced people. And believe me, if we gave them the mission, which is what the commander-in-chief does, they would be able to carry it out. And if we don't tie their hands behind their back, they will do it...extremely effectively.\",\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  u'And I have a lot more to say about it.',\n",
       "  u\"If Hillary is the candidate, which I doubt, that would be a dream come true. But you know, the fact of the matter is, she is the epitome of the progressive -- the secular progressive movement. And she counts on the fact that people are uninformed, the Alinsky Model, taking advantage of useful idiots. Well, I just happen to believe that people are not stupid. And the way I will come at it is to educate people, help people to actually understand that it is that progressive movement that is causing them the problems. You know, you look at the -- the national debt and how it's being driven up. If I was trying to destroy this country, what I would do is find a way to drive wedges between all the people, drive the debt to an unsustainable level, and then step off the stage as a world leader and let our enemies increase while we decreased our capacity as a military person. And that's what she's doing.\",\n",
       "  u\"Well, what we have to stop and think about is that we have weakened ourselves militarily to such an extent that if affects all of our military policies. Our Navy is at its smallest size since 1917; our Air Force, since 1940. In recent testimony, the commandant of the Marine Corps said half of the non-deployed units were not ready and you know, the sequester is cutting the heart out of our personnel. Our generals are retiring because they don't want to be part of this, and at the same time, our enemies are increasing. Our -- our friends can't trust us anymore. You know, Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state. They gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them. We won't even give them offensive weapons. You know, we turned our back on Israel, our ally. You know, in a situation like that, of course Obama's not going to be able to do anything. I would shore up our military first, because if you don't get the military right, nothing else is going to work.\",\n",
       "  u\"Well, I think the bully pulpit is a wonderful place to start healing that divide. You know, we have the purveyors of hatred who take every single incident between people of two races and try to make a race war out of it, and drive wedges into people. And this does not need to be done. What we need to think about instead -- you know, I was asked by an NPR reporter once, why don't I talk about race that often. I said it's because I'm a neurosurgeon. And she thought that was a strange response. And you say -- I said, you see, when I take someone to the operating room, I'm actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are. The skin doesn't make them who they are. The hair doesn't make them who they are. And it's time for us to move beyond that. Because...our strength as a nation comes in our unity. We are the United States of America, not the divided states. And those who want to destroy us are trying to divide us, and we shouldn't let them do it.\",\n",
       "  u\"Well, I haven't said anything about me being the only one to do anything, so let me try that. I'm the only one to separate Siamese twins...The -- the only one to operate on babies while they were still in mother's womb, the only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it. But I -- but I'm very hopeful that I'm not the only one who's willing to pick up the baton of freedom, because freedom is not free, and we must fight for it every day. Every one of us must fight for it, because we're fighting for our children and the next generation.\"],\n",
       " 'CHRISTIE': [u\"If you think it's bad now, you should've seen it when I got there. The fact is -- the fact is, in the eight years before I became governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times. In the eight years before I became governor, spending was increased 56 percent. And in the eight years before I become governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times. In the eight years before I became Governor, spending was increased 56 percent, and in the eight years before I became governor, there was zero net private sector job growth in New Jersey. Zero. For eight years. So, what did we do? We came in, we balanced an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget by cutting over 800 programs in the state budget. We brought the budget into balance with no tax increases. In fact, we vetoed five income tax increases during my time as governor. We cut business taxes $2.3 billion, and we cut regulation by one-third of what my predecessor put in place. And, what's happened since? A hundred ninety-two thousand private sector jobs in the five and a half years I've been governor. We have a lot of work to do in New Jersey, but I am darn proud we've brought our state back.\",\n",
       "  u\"Yes, I do. And I'll tell you why: because I'm the only person on this stage who's actually filed applications under the Patriot Act, who has gone before the federal -- the Foreign Intelligence Service court, who has prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after September 11th. I was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on September 10th, 2001, and the world changed enormously the next day, and that happened in my state. This is not theoretical to me. I went to the funerals. We lost friends of ours in the Trade Center that day. My own wife was two blocks from the Trade Center that day, at her office, having gone through it that morning. When you actually have to be responsible for doing this, you can do it, and we did it, for seven years in my office, respecting civil liberties and protecting the homeland. And I will make no apologies, ever, for protecting the lives and the safety of the American people. We have to give more tools to our folks to be able to do that, not fewer, and then trust those people and oversee them to do it the right way. As president, that is exactly what I'll do.\",\n",
       "  u'And -- and, Megyn? Megyn, that\\'s a -- that, you know, that\\'s a completely ridiculous answer. \"I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from other people.\" How are you supposed to know, Megyn?',\n",

I mean, so, there's a difference -- I'm the only guy on this stage who's put out a detailed, 12 point plan on entitlement reform and here's why -- because 71% of federal spending right now is on entitlements, and debt service, 71%. And we have spent the last hour and five minutes talking about the other 29%, and no time on the 71%, and that makes no sense. Now, let me tell you exactly what we would do on Social Security. Yes, we'd raise the retirement age two years, and phase it in over 25 years, that means we'd raise it one month a year for 25 years when we're all living longer, and living better lives. Secondly, we would means test Social Security for those who are making over $200,000 dollars a year in retirement income, and have $4 to $5 million dollars in liquid assets saved. They don't need that Social Security check. Social Security is meant to be -- to make sure that no one who's worked hard, and played by the rules, and paid into the system grows old in poverty in America. If we don't deal with this problem, it will bankrupt our country, or lead to massive tax increases, neither one that we want in this country.\",\n",

       "  '',\n",
       "  u\"Well, listen. You know, if we want to deal with these issues, we have to deal with them in a way that makes sense. I agree with what Dr. Carson said earlier. The first thing we need to do to make America stronger is to strengthen our military, and I put out a really specific plan: no less than 500,000 active duty soldiers in the Army. No less than 185,000 active duty marines in the Marine Corps. Bring us to a 350 ship Navy again, and modernize the Ohio class of submarines, and bring our Air Force back to 2,600 aircraft that are ready to go. Those are the kind of things that are going to send a clear message around the world. Those are the things that we need to start working on immediately to make our country stronger and make it better. Those are the things that we need to be able to be doing. And as we move towards dealing with foreign aid, I don't disagree with Senator Paul's position that we shouldn't be funding our enemies. But I absolutely believe that Israel is a priority to be able to fund and keep them strong and safe after eight years of this administration.\",\n",
       "  u\"Well, thank you, Megyn. Listen, I was born into a middle class family in New Jersey. My dad came home from serving in the Army after having lost his father, worked in the Breyers ice cream plant in Newark, New Jersey. Was the first person to graduate from college. He put himself through college at night. My mom was a secretary. I was appointed United States attorney on September 10, 2001. And I spent the next seven years of my career fighting terrorism and putting terrorists in jail. I'm a conservative, pro-life governor in a state where it is really tough to be both. A state like New Jersey, with lots of Democrats, but still we cut taxes, we balanced budgets. We fought the teacher's union. This president has had weak leadership, which has led to bad choices. We have got to stop worrying about being loved and start worrying about being respected. And that's exactly how I'll lead our country.\"],\n",
       " 'CRUZ': [u\"Chris, I believe the American people are looking for someone to speak the truth. If you're looking for someone to go to Washington, to go along to get along, to get -- to agree with the career politicians in both parties who get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests, then I ain't your guy. There is a reason.... that we have $18 trillion in debt. Because as conservatives, as Republicans, we keep winning elections. We got a Republican House, we've got a Republican Senate, and we don't have leaders who honor their commitments. I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would do.\",\n",
       "  u\"Chris, absolutely yes. And not only will I support it...I have authored Kate's law in the United States Senate and filed that legislation. I tried to get the Senate to vote to pass Kate's law on the floor of the Senate just one week ago, and the leader of our own party blocked a vote on Kate's law. You know, there was reference made to our leaders being stupid. It's not a question of stupidity. It's that they don't want to enforce the immigration laws. That there are far too many in the Washington cartel that support amnesty. President Obama has talked about fundamentally transforming this country. There's 7 billion people across the face of the globe, many of whom want to come to this country. If they come legally, great. But if they come illegally and they get amnesty, that is how we fundamentally change this country, and it really is striking. A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty. I have never supported amnesty, and I led the fight against Chuck Schumer's gang of eight amnesty legislation in the Senate.\",\n",
       "  u'Megyn, we need a commander in chief that speaks the truth. We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words, \"radical Islamic terrorism\". When I asked General Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs, what would be required militarily to destroy ISIS, he said there is no military solution. We need to change the conditions on the ground so that young men are not in poverty and susceptible to radicalization. That, with all due respect, is nonsense. It\\'s the same answer the State Department gave that we need to give them jobs. What we need is a commander in chief who makes -- clear, if you join ISIS, if you wage jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant.',\n",
       "  u'Megyn, of course it\\'s an ideological problem, that\\'s one of the reasons I introduce the Expatriate Terrorist Act in the Senate that said if any American travels to the Middle East and joining ISIS, that he or she forfeits their citizenship so they don\\'t use a passport to come back and wage jihad on Americans. Yes, it is ideological, and let me contrast President Obama, who at the prayer breakfast, essentially acted as an apologist. He said, \"Well, gosh, the crusades, the inquisitions--\" We need a president that shows the courage that Egypt\\'s President al-Sisi did, a Muslim, when he called out the radical Islamic terrorists who are threatening the world.',\n",
       "  u\"Well, Bret, of course they have, and over the last six and a half years we've seen the consequences of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy. Leading from behind is a disaster. We have abandoned and alienated our friends and allies, and our enemies are stronger. Radical Islam is on the rise, Iran's on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon, China is waging cyber warfare against America, Russia -- General Soleimani, you just mentioned, the Iranian general is the head of the al Quds forces. He's directly responsible for the murder of over 500 American servicemen in Iraq, and part of this Iranian deal was lifting the international sanctions on General Soleimani. The day General Soleimani flew back from Moscow to Iran was the day we believed that Russia used cyber warfare against the Joint Chiefs. We need a new commander in chief that will stand up to our enemies, and that will have credibility...It is worth emphasizing that Iran released our hostages in 1981 the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office.\",\n",
       "  u'Brett, can I -- Brett, can I jump in on this one?',\n",
       "  u'Well, I am blessed to receive a word from God every day in receiving the scriptures and reading the scriptures. And God speaks through the Bible. I\\'m the son of a pastor and evangelist and I\\'ve described many times how my father, when I was a child, was an alcoholic. He wasn\\'t a Christian. And my father left my mother and left me when I was just three years old. And someone invited him to Clay Road Baptist Church. And he gave his heart to Jesus and it turned him around. And he got on a plane and he flew back to my mother and me. I would also note that the scripture tells us, \"you shall know them by their fruit.\" We see lots of \"campaign conservatives.\" But if we\\'re going to win in 2016, we need a consistent conservative, someone who has been a fiscal conservative, a social conservative, a national security conservative. There are real differences among the candidates on issues like amnesty, like Obamacare, like religious liberty, like life and marriage. And I have been proud to fight and stand for religious liberty, to stand against Planned Parenthood, to defend life for my entire career. And I will be proud to continue to do so as president of the United States.',\n",
       "  u\"If I'm elected president, let me tell you about my first day in office. The first thing I intend to do is to rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama. The next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into these videos and to prosecute Planned Parenthood for any criminal violations. The next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice and the IRS to start (sic) persecuting religious liberty, and then intend to cancel the Iran deal, and finally move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. I will keep my word. My father fled Cuba, and I will fight to defend liberty because my family knows what it's like to lose it.\"],\n",
       " 'FIORINA': [u'When America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place. This is a bad deal. Obama broke every rule of negotiation. Yes, our allies are not perfect, but Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxy.'],\n",
       " 'HUCKABEE': [u\"Chris, I disagree with the idea that the real issue is a constitutional amendment. That's a long and difficult process. I've actually taken the position that's bolder than that. A lot of people are talking about defunding planned parenthood, as if that's a huge game changer. I think it's time to do something even more bold. I think the next president ought to invoke the Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the constitution now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mother's womb is a person at the moment of conception. The reason we know that it is is because of the DNA schedule that we now have clear scientific evidence on. And, this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn child's Fifth and 14th Amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law. It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being, and we change the policy to be pro-life and protect children instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like they're parts to a Buick.\",\n",
       "  u\"Not me. But you're welcome to give me a check, Donald if you'd like.\",\n",
       "  u\"It's not too big to shrink. But the problem is we have a Wall Street-to-Washington axis of power that has controlled the political climate. The donor class feeds the political class who does the dance that the donor class wants. And the result is federal government keeps getting bigger. Every person on this stage who has been a governor will tell that you the biggest fight they had was not the other party. Wasn't even the legislature. It was the federal government, who continually put mandates on the states that we had to suck up and pay for. And the fact is there are a lot of things happening at the federal level that are absolutely beyond the jurisdiction of the Constitution. This is power that should be shifted back to the states, whether it's the EPA, there is no role at the federal level for the Department of Education. And I'm still one who says that we can get rid of the Internal Revenue Service if we would pass the FairTax, which is a tax on consumption rather than a tax on people's income, and move power back where the founders believed it should have been all along.\",\n",
       "  u\"Well, let's all be reminded, 60 million Americans are on Social Security, 60 million. A third of those people depend on 90% of their income from Social Security. Nobody in this country is on Social Security because they made the decision when they were starting work at 14 that they wanted to trust some of their money with the government. The government took it out of their check whether they wanted them to or not. And, if person goes to 65, they're going to spend 51 years with the government reaching into their pocket at every paycheck. Now, here's the point, whose fault is it that the system is screwed up? Is it the recipients, or is it the government? And, if Congress wants to mess with the retirement program, why don't we let them start by changing their retirement program, and not have one, instead of talking about getting rid of Social Security and Medicare that was robbed $700 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare. It's always that the government figures that they can do this off the backs of people, many of whom are poor, and depend on that money, and I just think it's fundamentally lying to the people and stealing from them, and we shouldn't be doing it.\",\n",
       "  u\"Well, you ask about how we fund it. One of the reasons that Social Security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage. The people who get wages is declining dramatically. Most of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and -- and capital gains. The FairTax transforms the process by which we fund Social Security and Medicare because the money paid in consumption is paid by everybody, including illegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, all the people that are freeloading off the system now. That's why it ought to be a transformed system.\",\n",
       "  u'Ronald Reagan said \"trust, but verify.\" President Obama is \"trust, but vilify.\" He trusts our enemies and vilifies everyone who disagrees with him. And the reason we disagree with him has nothing to do with party.',\n",
       "  u'It has to do with the incredibly dangerous place that this world is gonna be as a result of a deal in which we got nothing. We didn\\'t even get four hostages out. We got nothing, and Iran gets everything they want. We said we would have anywhere, anytime negotiations and inspections, we gave that up. We said that we would make sure that they didn\\'t have any nuclear capacity, we gave that up. The president can\\'t tell us what we got. I\\'ll tell you what the world got. The world has a burgeoning nuclear power that didn\\'t, as the Soviets, say \"we might defend ourselves in a war.\" What the Iranians have said is, \"we will wipe Israel off the face of the map, and we will bring death to America.\" When someone points a gun at your head and loads it, by God, you ought to take them seriously, and we need to take that seriously.',\n",
       "  u\"The military is not a social experiment. The purpose of the military is kill people and break things. It's not to transform the culture by trying out some ideas that some people think would make us a different country and more diverse. The purpose is to protect America. I'm not sure how paying for transgender surgery for soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines makes our country safer. We've reduced the military by 25 percent...under President Obama. The disaster is that we've forgotten why we have a military. The purpose of it is to make sure that we protect every American, wherever that American is, and if an American is calling out for help, whether it's in Benghazi or at the border, then we ought to be able to answer it. We've not done that because we've decimated our military. We're flying B-52s. The most recent one that was put in service was November of 1962. A lot of the B-52s we're flying, we've only got 44 that are in service combat ready, and the fact is, most of them are older than me. And that's pretty scary.\",\n",

       " 'KASICH': [u\"Well, first of all...first of all, Megyn, you should know that -- that President Reagan expanded Medicaid three or four times. Secondly, I had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio to do what? To treat the mentally ill. Ten thousand of them sit in our prisons. It costs $22,500 a year...to keep them in prison. I'd rather get them their medication so they could lead a decent life. Secondly, we are rehabbing the drug-addicted. Eighty percent of the people in our prisons have addictions or problems. We now treat them in the prisons, release them in the community and the recidivism rate is 10 percent and everybody across this country knows that the tsunami of drugs is -- is threatening their very families. So we're treating them and getting them on their feet. And, finally, the working poor, instead of them having come into the emergency rooms where it costs more, where they're sicker and we end up paying, we brought a program in here to make sure that people could get on their feet. And do you know what? Everybody has a right to their God-given purpose. And finally, our Medicaid is growing at one of the lowest rates in the country. And, finally, we went from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black. We've cut $5 billion in taxes...and we've grown 350,000 jobs.\",\n",
       "  u\"Chris, first of all, I was just saying to Chris Christie, they say we're outspoken, we need to take lessons from Donald Trump if we're really going to learn it. Here is the thing about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is hitting a nerve in this country. He is. He's hitting a nerve. People are frustrated. They're fed up. They don't think the government is working for them. And for people who want to just tune him out, they're making a mistake. Now, he's got his solutions. Some of us have other solutions. You know, look, I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington. Hasn't been done since. I was a military reformer. I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole and a 350,000 job loss to a $2 billion surplus and a gain of 350,000 jobs.\",\n",
       "  u\"But the point is that we all have solutions. Mr. Trump is touching a nerve because people want the wall to be built. They want to see an end to illegal immigration. They want to see it, and we all do. But we all have different ways of getting there. And you're going to hear from all of us tonight about what our ideas are.\",\n",

       "  u'OK.',\n",
       "  u'Let\\'s start off with my father being a mailman. So I understand the concerns of all the folks across this country, some of whom have trouble, you know, making ends meet. But I think she will come in a narrow way. The nominee of this party, if they\\'re going to win, has got to come at it in a big way, which is pro-growth. Which is balancing budgets. You know, we were talking about it. People were saying, could we do it? I was the chairman of the Budget Committee and the lead architect the last time it happened in Washington, and when we did it we had great economic growth, we cut taxes, and we had a big surplus. Economic growth is the key. Economic growth is the key to everything. But once you have economic growth, it is important that we reach out to people who live in the shadows, the people who don\\'t seem to ever think that they get a fair deal. And that includes people in our minority community; that includes people who feel as though they don\\'t have a chance to move up. You know, America is a miracle country. And we have to restore the sense that the \"Amiracle\" will apply to you. Each and every one of the people in this country who\\'s watching tonight, lift everybody, unite everybody and build a stronger United States of America again. It will be and can be done.',\n",
       "  u\"Well, look, I'm an old-fashioned person here, and I happen to believe in traditional marriage. But I've also said the court has ruled --\",\n",
       "  u\"Wait, Megyn, the court has ruled, and I said we'll accept it. And guess what, I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay. Because somebody doesn't think the way I do, doesn't mean that I can't care about them or can't love them. So if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them. Because you know what? That's what we're taught when we have strong faith. So the issues like that, issues like that are planted to divide us. I think the simple fact of the matter is, and this is where I would agree with Jeb, and I've been saying it all along, we need to give everybody a chance, treat everybody with respect, and let them share in this great American dream that we have, Megan. So, look, I'm going to love my daughters, I'm going to love them no matter what they do. Because, you know what, God gives me unconditional love. I'm going to give it to my family and my friends and the people around me.\",\n",
       "  u\"Well, Megyn, my father was a mailman. His father was a coal miner. My mother's mother could barely speak English. And their son today stands on this podium in the great state of Ohio not only as the governor, but a candidate for president of the United States. I do believe in miracles. You know, I've had a lot of elections. But my elections are really not about campaigns. I tell my people that these are about a movement. And a movement to do what? To restore common sense. A movement to do things like provide economic growth. And a movement not to let anybody be behind. You know, today the country is divided. You asked a question about the police and the difficulty in communities. We've got to unite our country again, because we're stronger when we are united and we are weaker when we are divided. And we've got to listen to other people's voices, respect them, but keep in mind, and I believe in terms of the things that I've read in my lifetime, the Lord'is not picking us. But because of how we respect human rights, because that we are a good force in the world, he wants America to be strong. He wants America to succeed. And he wants America to lead. And nothing is more important to me than my family, my faith, and my friends.\",\n",
       "  u\"You know, tonight we hear about what people want to do. I want to tell you what I've done. I was a member of the Armed Services Committee for 18 years. I spent a big chunk of my life studying national security issues and our role in the world. No. 2. I was the chairman of the House Budget Committee and one of the chief architects the last time we balanced a budget, and it was the first time we had done it since man walked on the moon. We had a $5 trillion surplus and we cut taxes. I spent ten years in the private sector, actually learning how business works. And now I'm the governor of Ohio, and I inherited a state that was on the brink of dying. And we turned it all around with jobs and balanced budgets and rising credit and tax cuts, and the state is unified, and people have hope again in Ohio.\"],\n",

You've suggested that the Baltic States are not a part of NATO, just months ago you were unfamiliar with the major political parties and government in Israel, and domestically, you thought Alan Greenspan had been treasury secretary instead of federal reserve chair.

       "  u\"Governor Walker, you've consistently said that you want to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. You recently signed an abortion law in Wisconsin that does have an exception for the mother's life, but you're on the record as having objected to it. Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion, and with 83 percent of the American public in favor of a life exception, are you too out of the mainstream on this issue to win the general election?\",\n",
       "  u\"Governor Kasich, You chose to expand Medicaid in your state, unlike several other governors on this stage tonight, and it is already over budget by some estimates costing taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion in just the first 18 months. You defended your Medicaid expansion by invoking God, saying to skeptics that when they arrive in heaven, Saint Peter isn't going to ask them how small they've kept government, but what they have done for the poor. Why should Republican voters, who generally want to shrink government, believe that you won't use your Saint Peter rationale to expand every government program?\",\n",
       "  u\"Alright, gentlemen, we're gonna switch topics now and talk a bit about terror and national security. Governor Christie. You've said that Senator Paul's opposition to the NSA's collection of phone records has made the United States weaker and more vulnerable, even going so far as to say that he should be called before Congress to answer for it if we should be hit by another terrorist attack. Do you really believe you can assign blame to Senator Paul just for opposing the bulk collection of people's phone records in the event of a terrorist attack?\",\n",

Let me begin by saying this: I'm not new to the political process; I was making a contribution as the speaker of the third largest and most diverse state in the country well before I even got into the Senate. I would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition. It's important to be qualified, but if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton's gonna be the next president, because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight. Here's what this election better be about: This election better be about the future, not the past. It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced. This country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed. You know, the largest retailer in the country and the world today, Amazon, doesn't even own a single store? And these changes have been disruptive. They have changed people's lives. The jobs that once sustained our middle class, they either don't pay enough or they are gone, and we need someone that understands that as our nominee. If I'm our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised paycheck to paycheck. How is she -- how is she gonna lecture me -- how is she gonna lecture me about student loans? I owed over $100,000 just four years ago. If I'm our nominee, we will be the party of the future.\",\n",
       "  u\"Let me set the record straight on a couple of things. The first is, the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico. They're coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras. Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority. I also believe we need a fence. The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too. And that's why you need an e-verify system and you need an entry-exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration. But I agree with what Governor Kasich just said. People are frustrated. This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like we're being taken advantage of. We feel like despite our generosity, we're being taken advantage of. And let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates. The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States. And they've paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can't get in. And they're wondering, maybe they should come illegally. And so these are important issues, and we should address it. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and otherwise we're going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years, like we have for the last 30 years.\",\n",

       "  u\"Well, first off, I too believe in curriculum reform. It is critically important in the 21st Century. We do need curriculum reform. And it should happen at the state and local level. That's...that's...that is where educational policy belongs, because if a parent is unhappy with what their child is being taught in school, they can go to that local school board or their state legislature, or their governor and get it changed. Here's the problem with Common Core. The Department of Education, like every federal agency, will never be satisfied. They will not stop with it being a suggestion. They will turn it into a mandate. In fact, what they will begin to say to local communities is, you will not get federal money unless do you things the way we want you to do it. And they will use Common Core or any other requirements that exists nationally to force it down the throats of our people in our states.\",\n",
       "  u\"That's a great question.\",\n",
       "  u\"That's a great question. First of all, it begins by having leaders that recognize that the economy we live in today is dramatically different from the one we had five years ago. It's an economy that now has placed us in global competition with dozens of other countries around the world. Now, the big companies that have connections with Washington, they can affect policies to help them, but the small companies like the one Tania is talking about, they're the ones that are struggling. The first thing we need to do is we need to even out the tax code for small businesses so that we lower their tax rate to 25 percent, just as we need to lower it for all businesses. We need to have a regulatory budget in America that limits the amount of regulations on our economy. We need to repeal and replace Obamacare and we need to improve higher education so that people can have access to the skills they need for 21st century jobs. And last but not least, we need to repeal Dodd-Frank. It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks. 20 \\u2014 over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out over the \\u2014 since Dodd-Frank has passed. We need to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank. We need to make America fair again for all businesses, but especially those being run by small business owners.\",\n",

What I have advocated is that we pass law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection. In fact, I think that law already exists. It is called the Constitution of the United States. And let me go further. I believe that every single human being is entitled to the protection of our laws, whether they can vote or not. Whether they can speak or not. Whether they can hire a lawyer or not. Whether they have a birth certificate or not. And I think future generations will look back at this history of our country and call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies who we never gave them a chance to live.',\n",

And he has blessed us with young men and women willing to risk their lives and sometimes die in uniform for the safety and security of our people. Unfortunately today we have a VA that does not do enough for them. I am proud that last year we helped change the law. We changed the law to give the power to the VA secretary the ability to fire any executive that isn't doing their job. And it is outrageous they've only fired one person to date. When I'm president of the United States, we're going to have a VA that cares more about our veterans than about the bureaucrats who work at the VA.\",\n",

Here in this country, they never made it big, but the very purpose of their life was to give us the chance to do all the things they never could. My father was a bartender. And the journey from the back of that bar to this stage tonight, to me, that is the essence of the American dream. It is what makes our nation different. And I'm running for president because I want that to still be possible for the people trying to do that now. I run for president because I believe that we can't just save the American dream; we can expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before.

I have a big company with thousands and thousands of employees. And if I'm negotiating in New York or in New Jersey or in California, I have like one bidder. Nobody can bid. You know why? Because the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians, of course, with the exception of the politicians on this stage. But they have total control of the politicians. They're making a fortune. Get rid of the artificial lines and you will have...yourself great plans.

I think most of us in America understand that people, not the government creates jobs. And one of the best things we can do is get the government out of the way, repeal Obamacare, put in -- reign in all the out of control regulations, put in place an all of the above energy policy, give people the education, the skills that the need to succeed, and lower the tax rate and reform the tax code. That's what I'll do as president, just like I did in Wisconsin.\",\n",
       "  u\"Well, first off, let's remember. I still remember, as a kid, tying a yellow ribbon around a tree in front of my house during the 444 days that Iran held 52 Americans hostage. Iran is not a place we should be doing business with. To me, you terminate the deal on day one, you reinstate the sanctions authorized by Congress, you go to Congress and put in place even more crippling sanctions in place, and then you convince our allies to do the same. This is not just bad with Iran, this is bad with ISIS. It is tied together, and, once and for all, we need a leader who's gonna stand up and do something about it. It's yet another example of the failed foreign policy of the Obama-Clinton doctrine.\",\n",
       "  u\"Well, I think the most important thing we can do when it comes to policing -- it's something you've had a guest on who's a friend of mine Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clark, who's talked to me about this many times in the past -- it's about training. It's about making sure that law enforcement professionals, not only in the way in to their positions but all the way through their time, have the proper training, particularly when it comes to the use of force. And that we protect and stand up and support those men and women who are doing their jobs in law enforcement. And for the very few that don't, that there are consequences to show that we treat everyone the same here in America.\",\n",
       "  u\"Well first off, for the cyber attack with Russia the other day, it's sad to think right now, but probably the Russian and Chinese government know more about Hillary Clinton's e-mail server than do the members of the United States Congress. And -- and that has put our national security at risk. If I am president, he won't think about that. You know, Putin believes in the old Lenin adage: you probe with bayonets. When you find mush, you push. When you find steel, you stop. Under Obama and Clinton, we found a lot of mush over the last two years. We need to have a national security that puts steel in front of our enemies. I would send weapons to Ukraine. I would work with NATO to put forces on the eastern border of Poland and the Baltic nations, and I would reinstate, put in place back in the missile defense system that we had in Poland and in the Czech Republic. We find steel.\",\n",
       "  u\"Well, thanks, Megyn. I'm certainly an imperfect man. And it's only by the blood of Jesus Christ that I've been redeemed from my sins. So I know that God doesn't call me to do a specific thing, God hasn't given me a list, a Ten Commandments, if you will, of things to act on the first day. What God calls us to do is follow his will. And ultimately that's what I'm going to try to do. And I hope people've seen it in my state, even in the big challenges I took on when I had over 100,000 protesters in and around our capital, trying to do what I thought was the right thing. It wasn't just how I took on those political battles. It was ultimately how I acted. Not responding in kind. Not lashing out. But just being decent going forward and living my life in a way that would be a testimony to him and our faith.\",\n",
       "  u'Thanks. I\\'m guy with a wife and two kids, and Harley. One article called me \"aggressively normal.\" I ran for governor because I was worried about my kids\\' future. Then, I took on the big government union bosses, and we won. They tried to recall me, and we won. They target us again, and we won. We balanced the budget, cut taxes, and turned our state around with big, bold reforms. It wasn\\'t too late for Wisconsin, and it\\'s not too late for America. That\\'s why I ask for your vote.'],\n",
       " 'WALLACE': [u\"Also of note, Fox News is partnering for tonight's debate with Facebook. For the past several weeks, we've been asking you for questions for the candidates on Facebook. Nearly 6 million of you, 6 million, viewed the debate videos on our site, and more than 40,000 of you submitted questions: some of which you will hear us asking the candidates tonight.\",\n",
       "  u'Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. And your very own governor of Ohio...John Kasich.',\n",
       "  u'Brett -- Brett, I think you would call that a home field advantage.',\n",
       "  u'Senator Rubio, when Jeb Bush announced his candidacy for presidency, he said this: \"There\\'s no passing off responsibility when you\\'re a governor, no blending into the legislative crowd.\" Could you please address Governor Bush across the stage here, and explain to him why you, someone who has never held executive office, are better prepared to be president than he is, a man who you say did a great job running your state of Florida for eight years.',\n",
       "  u\"Senator Cruz, your colleague, Senator Paul, right there next to you, said a few months ago he agrees with you on a number of issues, but he says you do nothing to grow the party. He says you feed red meat to the base, but you don't reach out to minorities. You have a toxic relationship with GOP leaders in Congress. You even called the Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell a liar recently. How can you win in 2016 when you're such a divisive figure?\",\n",
       "  u\"Governor Huckabee, like Governor Walker, you have staked out strong positions on social issues. You favor a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage. You favor a constitutional amendment banning abortions, except for the life of the mother. Millions of people in this country agree with you, but according to the polls, and again this an electability question, according to the polls, more people don't, so how do you persuade enough Independents and Democrats to get elected in 2016?\",\n",
       "  u'Gentlemen, we\\'re turning to a new subject that all of you have been talking about and some of you have been disagreeing about, and that is the issue of immigration. Governor Bush, you released a new plan this week on illegal immigration focusing on enforcement, which some suggest is your effort to show that you\\'re not soft on that issue. I want to ask you about a statement that you made last year about illegal immigrants. And here\\'s what you said. \"They broke the law, but it\\'s not a felony, it\\'s an act of love. It\\'s an act of commitment to your family.\" Do you stand by that statement and do you stand by your support for earned legal status?',\n",
       "  u'Thank you, sir. Mr. Trump, it has not escaped anybody\\'s notice that you say that the Mexican government, the Mexican government is sending criminals -- rapists, drug dealers, across the border. Governor Bush has called those remarks, quote, \"extraordinarily ugly.\" I\\'d like you -- you\\'re right next to him -- tell us -- talk to him directly and say how you respond to that and -- and you have repeatedly said that you have evidence that the Mexican government is doing this, but you have evidence you have refused or declined to share. Why not use this first Republican presidential debate to share your proof with the American people?',\n",
       "  u\"Mr. Trump, I'll give you 30 seconds -- I'll give you 30 seconds to answer my question, which was, what evidence do you have, specific evidence that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border? Thirty seconds.\",\n",
       "  u\"All right. Obviously there's a lot more to talk about this. We're going to have more questions for the candidates on illegal immigration, plus other key topics including your questions on Facebook.\",\n",
       "  u\"Welcome back to FOX News/Facebook Republican Debate Night. We're going to continue the questions now on illegal immigration. We kind of ended with a cliffhanger there. So let's continue the conversation. Governor Kasich, I know you don't like to talk about Donald Trump. But I do want to ask you about the merit of what he just said. When you say that the American government is stupid, that the Mexican government is sending criminals, that we're being bamboozled, is that an adequate response to the question of illegal immigration?\",\n",
       "  u'Respectfully, can we talk about illegal immigration?',\n",
       "  u'All right, well, Senator Rubio, let me see if I can do better with you. Is it as simple as our leaders are stupid, their leaders are smart, and all of these illegals coming over are criminals?',\n",
       "  u\"Governor Walker. Governor Walker, from 2002 until as recently as 2013, just two years ago, you supported comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship. Now you say that was a quick reaction to something you hadn't really thought about, and that you've changed your mind. Other than politics, could you explain why in the last two years you've changed your position on a path to citizenship, and are there other past positions that we shouldn't hold you to?\",\n",
       "  u'Senator Cruz, some 1,400 people submitted questions on this very hot topic of illegal immigration on Facebook, and a number of them were about the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco, allegedly shot down by an illegal. Doug Bettencourt sent this question, \"will you support Kate Steinle\\'s Law,\" which would impose a mandatory five-year prison term for an illegal who is deported and then returns to this country? \"And will you defund sanctuary cities for violating federal law?\"',\n",
       "  u\"Gentlemen, we're obviously digging into some subjects in depth, but we're also going to change it up every once in a while throughout the next hour and have many rounds where we ask, you are not going to like it, only a couple of candidates questions on those subjects. This is the first of the many rounds, and it's about somebody whose name probably hasn't been mentioned enough so far tonight. Governor Kasich, let me start with you. Whoever the Republican nominee -- Whoever the Republican nominee is, it looks at least for now like whoever that nominee is, he or she, will be facing off against Hillary Clinton. You know how she will come after whoever the Republican nominee is. She will say that you, whoever it is, support the rich while she supports the middle class. That you want to suppress the rights of women and minorities. She wants to move the country forward while you, the Republicans, want to take the country back to the past. How will you, if you're the nominee, how will you answer that and take Hillary Clinton on?\",\n",
       "  u\"I know that all of you would like to answer this question, but we're only going to ask one other candidate before we move on to a different subject, Dr. Carson. Basically, same question to you. If Hillary Clinton is the nominee and she comes at you with that kind of line of attack, how will you take Iraq?\",\n",
       "  u\"Gentlemen, we're going to turn now to the subject of the economy, jobs and money and the government. And Governor Bush, I'm going to start with you. You have made a bold promise in your announcement. You have promised four percent economic growth and 19 million new jobs if you are fortunate enough to serve two terms as president. That many jobs, 19 million, would be triple what your father and your brother accomplished together. And four percent growth, the last president to average that was Lyndon Johnson during the height of the Vietnam War. So question, how on Earth specifically would you pull that off?\",\n",
       "  u\"Governor Walker. Governor Walker, when you ran for governor of Wisconsin back in 2010, you promised that you would create 250,000 jobs in your first term, first four years. In fact, Wisconsin added barely half that and ranked 35th in the country in job growth. Now you're running for president, and you're promising an economic plan in which everyone will earn a piece of the American dream. Given your record in Wisconsin, why should voters believe you?\",\n",
       "  u'Governor Christie, I want to engage you and Governor Huckabee in a subject that is a big issue in both of your campaigns, and that is entitlement reform. You say that you -- to save the system that you want to raise the retirement age -- have to raise the retirement age, and to cut benefits for Social Security and Medicare, and you say that some of the candidates here on the stage are lying. Governor Huckabee says he can save Social Security and Medicare without doing any of that. Is he lying?',\n",
       "  u'Governor Huckabee? You say that changing entitlements, the kind of thing that Governor Christie is talking about, would be breaking a promise to the American people, and you say that you can keep those programs, save Social Security, save Medicare, without those kinds of reforms through a FairTax, which is a broad tax on consumption. Please explain to Governor Christie how that would work, and how you could save these programs without the kind of painful reforms he says we need?',\n",
       "  u'...Thirty seconds.',\n",
       "  u'...Alright, this is it. Thirty Seconds, finally.',\n",
       "  u'All right. Enough. Mr. Trump.',\n",
       "  u'Mr. Trump, you talk a lot about how you are the person on this stage to grow the economy, I want to ask you about your business records. From corporations, Trump corporations, casinos and hotels, have declared bankruptcy four times over the last quarter-century.',\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  u\"...that's your line, but your companies have gone bankrupt.\",\n",
       "  u\"Well sir, let's just talk about the latest example...which is Trump Entertainment Resorts, which went bankrupt in 2009. In that case alone, lenders to your company lost over $1 billion and more than 1,100 people were laid off.\",\n",

Alright. [laughter and boing]\\n\\n Governor Bush, you have insisted that you\\'re your own man. You say you have a life experience uniquely your own. Not your father\\'s, not your brother\\'s.\\n\\nBut there are several opponents on this stage who get big- applause lines in early voting states with this line: quote, \"the last thing the country needs is another Bush in the Oval Office.\"\\n\\nSo do you understand the real concern in this country about dynastic politics?\\n\\n Governor Christie, you\\'re not exactly the darling of conservatives. You tout your record as a Republican governor in a blue state. On Facebook, the most people talking about you, not surprisingly, come from your state of New Jersey, and one of the top issues they are talking about is the economy.\\n\\nThis -- this may be why. Under your watch, New Jersey has undergone nine credit rating downgrades. The state\\'s 44th in private sector growth. You face an employee pension crisis and the Garden State has the third highest foreclosure rate in the country. So why should voters believe that your management of the country\\'s finances would be any different?\\n\\n Senator Paul, you recently blamed the rise of ISIS on Republican hawks. You later said that that statement, you could have said it better. But, the statement went on, and you said, quote, \"Everything they\\'ve talked about in foreign policy, they\\'ve been wrong for the last 20 years.\"\\n\\nWhy are you so quick to blame your own party?\\n\\n Gentlemen, the next series of questions deals with ObamaCare and the role of the federal government.\\n\\nMr. Trump, ObamaCare is one of the things you call a disaster.\\n\\n Saying it needs to be repealed and replaced.\\n\\n Now, 15 years ago, you called yourself a liberal on health care. You were for a single-payer system, a Canadian-style system.\\n\\nWhy were you for that then and why aren\\'t you for it now?\\n\\n But on ObamaCare...\\n\\n Mr. Trump, hold up one second.\\n\\n All right, now, hold on, Senator Paul...\\n\\n OK.\\n\\n All right, let me... [applause]\\n\\nMr. Trump, it\\'s not just your past support for single- payer health care. You\\'ve also supported a host of other liberal policies. Use -- you\\'ve also donated to several Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton included, Nancy Pelosi.\\n\\nYou explained away those donations saying you did that to get business-related favors.\\n\\nAnd you said recently, quote, \"When you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.\"\\n\\n So what specifically did...\\n\\n -- they do?\\n\\n Hold on.\\n\\nWe\\'re going to -- we\\'re going to move on. [crosstalk] We\\'ll come back to you, Governor Walker.\\n\\n We have many questions to come.\\n\\n Many questions to come. [applause] Governor Huckabee, on Facebook, John Pietricone asked this, \"Will you abolish or take away the powers and cut the size of the EPA, the IRS, the Department of Education?\"\\n\\nNow, broadly... [applause] ...broadly, the size of government is a big concern for Facebook users, Facebook persons, as well as, obviously, conservatives.\\n\\nBut year after year, decade after decade, there are promises from Republicans to shrink government. But year after year, decade after decade, it doesn\\'t happen.\\n\\nIn fact, it gets bigger, even under Republican politicians.\\n\\nSo the question is, at this point, is the government simply too big for any one person, even a Republican, to shrink?\\n\\n Dr. Carson...\\n\\n Dr. Carson, do you agree with that?\\n\\n Governor Bush?\\n\\n We\\'re going to come back to you, Dr. Carson.\\n\\nGovernor Bush, you are one of the few people on the stage who advocates for Common Core education standards, reading and math. A lot of people on this stage vigorously oppose a federal involvement in education. They say it should all be handled locally.\\n\\nPresident Obama\\'s secretary of education, Arnie Duncan, has said that most of the criticism of Common Core is due to a, quote, \"fringe group of critics.\" Do you think that\\'s accurate?\\n\\n Senator Rubio, why is Governor Bush wrong on Common Core?\\n\\n And do you agree with your old friend?\\n\\n We have many more questions coming on a host of topics, here from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. Stay with us.\\n\\n[video clip begins]\\n\\n We have many more questions coming on a host of topics. Here from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. Stay with us.\\n\\n[video clip begins]\\n\\n Gentlemen, another question for a few of you.\\n\\nYesterday, just yesterday, President Obama criticized Republican lawmakers trying to block the Iran deal, calling them knee-jerk partisans, adding that hardliners in Iran who chant \"death to America\" were, quote, \"making common cause with the Republican caucus.\"\\n\\nHere\\'s what two of your opponents on the 5 p.m. debate stage said about Iran.\\n\\n[video clip begins]\\n\\n Now, I wanna ask a few of you this. First, Governor Walker.\\n\\nYou\\'ve said that you would tear up the Iran deal on day one. If this deal is undone, what then?\\n\\n Senator Paul, would you tear up the deal on day one?\\n\\n Governor Huckabee, what do you think about what Senator Paul just said?\\n\\n Thank you, gentlemen.\\n\\n Welcome back to Cleveland. Our next topic is foreign policy. Candidates, you may not have seen the late developing news today our Fox Pentagon team broke earlier this evening about a top Iranian general traveling to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\\n\\nHis name is General Qassem Soleimani, he\\'s blamed for hundreds of U.S. troop\\'s deaths in Iraq, and Afghanistan. His trip to Russia appears to directly violate U.N. Security Council resolutions to confine him to Iran.\\n\\nSo, Mr. Trump, if you were president, how would you respond to this?\\n\\n Another new development today, Senior Defense officials tell Fox they strongly suspect Russia was behind the cyber attack on the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs office...\\n\\n ...email. This comes in the wake of the Director of National Intelligence blaming the Chinese for the largest ever cyber attack, stealing personal data of tens of millions of Americans.\\n\\nSenator Cruz, in your view, have Russia and China committed acts of cyber war, and if you were president, what would you do about it?\\n\\n Dr. Carson, in August of 2012 President Obama famously declared Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons, quote, \"that\\'s a redline for us,\" and that there would be enormous consequences.\\n\\nOne year later, with overwhelming evidence the Assad had, in fact, used chemical weapons and crossed that red line, President Obama declined to use military force against the Assad regime.\\n\\nAs president, would you have used military force there?\\n\\n Governor Walker, as president, what would you do if Russian President Vladimir Putin started a campaign to destabilize NATO allies Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, mirroring the actions Putin took at the early days of Ukraine?\\n\\n Governor -- Governor Huckabee, the culture of the American military is definitely changing. Women are moving into combat roles. Don\\'t Ask, Don\\'t Tell has obviously been dropped. And now Defense Secretary Ashton Carter recently directed the military to prepare for a moment when it is welcoming transgender persons to serve openly.\\n\\nAs commander in chief, how would you handle that?\\n\\n Senator Paul, the first budget you proposed as senator cut all financial aid to Israel. You have since changed your view on that issue. What made you change your mind.\\n\\n OK. But you still say that Israel could be one of the countries that is cut from financial aid?\\n\\n Governor Christie, what do you think of that answer?\\n\\n Governor, thank you.\\n\\n Senator, we\\'re going to finish up with some more questions, thank you.\\n\\n Now each candidate will make a closing statement. You\\'ll all have 30 seconds to make a closing statement for this debate. We\\'ll start with Ohio Governor John Kasich.\\n\\n Senator Marco Rubio.\\n\\n Thank you, Senator.\\n\\n Governor Mike Huckabee, closing statement.\\n\\n Mr. Trump, closing statement, sir.\\n\\n Gentlemen, thank you.\\n\\n That\\'s it.\\n\\n', u'', ...],\n",

I\\'m sorry, I just want to get the answer.\\n\\n So you would support a shutdown.\\n\\n Governor Bush, Mr. Trump has suggested that your views on immigration are influenced by your Mexican born wife.

You said, quote, \"He should really set an example by speaking English in the United States.\"\\n\\nWhat\\'s wrong with speaking Spanish?\\n\\n Thank you.\\n\\n ...Thank you....\\n\\n Governor Bush, let\\'s talk about the issue that\\'s very important to Republican voters, and that\\'s the Supreme Court. After Chief Justice John Roberts voted to uphold Obamacare twice, Senator Cruz criticized your brother for appointing John Roberts to the Supreme Court.\\n\\nLooking back on it, did your brother make a mistake?\\n\\n ...Is John Roberts one of those people?\\n\\n Do you like what you just heard, Senator Cruz?\\n\\n Mr. Trump, you have said once or twice that you are really rich, and you are by far the richest person on this stage.\\n\\nChris Christie says billionaires like you and even people who make and earn far less should no longer get Social Security, or at least there should be limits based on \\u2014 on their income.\\n\\nYou think he\\'s wrong, and if so, why?\\n\\n What about the country as a \\u2014 as a policy?\\n\\n So is a voluntary program the way to get the Social Security system solvent again like that.\\n\\n', ...],\n",

We need to eliminate the sanctuary cities in this country. It is ridiculous and tragic...[applause]...that people are dying because of the fact that -- that local governments are not following the federal law. There's much to do.

Not -- not amnesty, earned legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time.\\n\\n ...I remember...\\n\\n ...I remember, Megyn. [laughter]\\n\\n Knowing what we know now, with faulty intelligence, and not having security be the first priority when -- when we invaded, it was a mistake. I wouldn't have gone in, however, for the people that did lose their lives, and the families that suffer because of it -- I know this full well because as governor of the state of Florida, I called every one of them. Every one of them that I could find to tell them that I was praying for them, that I cared about them, and it was really hard to do.\\n\\nAnd, every one of them said that their child did not die in vain, or their wife, of their husband did not die in vain.\\n\\nSo, why it was difficult for me to do it was based on that. Here's the lesson that we should take from this, which relates to this whole subject. Barack Obama became president, and he abandoned Iraq. He left, and when he left Al Qaida was done for. ISIS was created because [timer sounds] of the void that we left, and that void now exists as a caliphate the size of Indiana.\\n\\nTo honor the people that died, we need to -- we need to --- stop the -- Iran agreement, for sure, because the Iranian mullahs have their blood on their hands, and we need to take out ISIS with every tool at our disposal. [applause]\\n\\n No, I don't. And I don't believe the federal government should be involved in the creation of standards directly or indirectly, the creation of curriculum or content. It is clearly a state responsibility.\\n\\nI'm for higher standards... [applause] ...measured in an intellectually honest way, with abundant school choice, ending social promotion. And I know how to do this because as governor of the state of Florida I created the first statewide voucher program in the country, the second statewide voucher program, in the country and the third statewide voucher program in the country.\\n\\nAnd we had rising student achievement across the board, because high standards, robust accountability, ending social promotion in third grade, real school choice across the board, challenging the teachers union and beating them is the way to go.\\n\\nAnd Florida's low income kids had the greatest gains inside the country. Our graduation rate improved by 50 percent. That's what I'm for.\\n\\n He is definitely my friend. And I think the states ought to create these standards. And if states want to opt out of Common Core, fine. Just make sure your standards are high.\\n\\nBecause today in America, a third of our kids, after we spend more per student than any country in the world other than a couple rounding errors, to be honest with you, 30 percent are college- and/or career-ready.\\n\\nIf we are going to compete in this world we're in today, there is no possible way we can do it with lowering expectations and dumbing down everything. Children are going to suffer and families' hearts are going to be broken that their kids won't be able to get a job in the 21st Century. [applause]\\n\\n We've done it 27 times since World War II. I think we need to lift our spirits and have high, lofty expectations for this great country of ours.\\n\\nThe new normal of two percent that the left is saying you can't do anything about is so dangerous for our country. There's 6 million people living in poverty today, more than when Barack Obama got elected. 6.5 million people are working part-time, most of whom want to work full-time. We've created rules and taxes on top of every aspiration of people, and the net result is we're not growing fast, income's not growing. A four percent growth strategy means you fix a convoluted tax code. You get in and you change every aspect of regulations that are job killers. You get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something that doesn't suppress wages and kill jobs. [applause]\\n\\nYou embrace the energy revolution in our country. This president and Hillary Clinton, who can't even say she's for the XL pipeline even after she's left? Give me a break. Of course we're for it. We should be for these things to create high sustained economic growth. And frankly, [timer sounds] fixing our immigration system and turning it into an economic driver is part of this as well. We can do this. [applause]\\n\\n None of which is true.\\n\\n No. It's not true. But I have said that Mr. Trump's language is divisive.\\n\\nI want to win. I want one of these people here or the ones at 5:00, to be the next president of the United States.\\n\\nWe're not going on win by doing what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton do each and every day. Dividing the country. Saying, creating a grievance kind of environment. We're going to win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message. I have that message because I was a governor of a state that saw people lifted up, because we had high sustained economic growth. Our economy grew at double the rate of the nation. We created 1.3 million jobs. We led the nation seven out of those eight years. We were only one of two states that went to AAA bond rating. I cut taxes, $19 billion. If you do that and apply conservative principles the right way, you create an environment where everybody rises up. That's how we're going to win. Campaigning in places to give people hope that their life is better because too many people are suffering today in America.\\n\\n Here's what I believe. I believe we're at the verge of the greatest time to be alive in this world.\\n\\nBut Washington is holding us back. How we tax, how we regulate. We're not embracing the energy revolution in our midst, a broken immigration system that has been politicized rather than turning it into an economic driver.\\n\\nWe're not protecting and preserving our entitlement system or reforming for the next generation. All these things languish while we have politicians in Washington using these as wedge issues.\\n\\nHere's my commitment to you, because I did it as Florida. We can fix these things. We can grow economically and restore America's leadership in the world, so that everybody has a chance to rise up. I humbly ask for your vote, whenever you're gonna get to vote, whenever the primary is. Thank you all very much.\\n\\n\", u' I\\'m Jeb Bush, and I believe America\\'s on the verge of its greatest century, and I\\'m ready to lead. I\\'m a committed, conservative reformer that cut taxes, that balanced budgets, that took on the special interest in Florida, and we won.\\n\\nI look forward to talking tonight about how we can fix a broken Washington D.C., and create an environment where people can rise up again in this great country.\\n\\nThank you. [applause]\\n\\n I think the voters will make that determination.\\n\\nBut what I know to be true is that the next president of the United States is going to have to fix an extraordinary difficult situation. This administration, with President Obama and Hillary Clinton, has created insecurity the likes of which we never would\\'ve imagined. There\\'s not a place in the world where we\\'re better off today than six and a half years ago.\\n\\nAnd that requires a steadiness. That requires an understanding of how the world works. That requires an understanding and appreciation of American leadership in the world.\\n\\nYou can\\'t just, you know, talk about this stuff and insult leaders around the world and expect a good result. You have to do this with a steady hand, and I believe I have those skills.\\n\\n No. Absolutely not. People are supporting me because I have a proven record of conservative leadership where I cut taxes $19 billion over eight years. We shrunk the state government workforce, we created a climate that led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years. We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating. People know that we need principle-centered leadership, a disrupter to go to Washington, D.C. The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something \\u2014 that was generous and gave me money \\u2014 was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida \\u2014\\n\\n Yes you did.\\n\\n You wanted it and you didn\\'t get it because I was opposed to \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 casino gambling before \\u2014\\n\\n during and after. And that\\'s not \\u2014 I\\'m not going to be bought by anybody.\\n\\n No way. Believe me.\\n\\n Not even possible.\\n\\n You\\'ve got, according to your \\u2014 to what you said on one of the talk shows, you got Hillary Clinton to go to your wedding \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 because you gave her money. Maybe it works for Hillary Clinton \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 it doesn\\'t work for anybody on this \\u2014 on stage.\\n\\n But the simple fact is \\u2014\\n\\n No. The simple fact is, Donald, you could not take \\u2014\\n\\n I was asked the question.\\n\\n So he supports Pelosi, he supports Schumer, he supports Clinton \\u2014\\n\\n When he \\u2014 and he \\u2014 when he asked \\u2014 when he asked Florida to have casino gambling, we said no.\\n\\n We said no. And that\\'s the simple fact. The simple fact is \\u2014\\n\\n Don\\'t cut me off.\\n\\n No, I don\\'t think so, but we need to be strong against China. We should use offensive tactics as it relates to cyber security, send a deterrent signal to China. There should be super sanctions in what President Obama has proposed. There\\'s many other tools that we have without canceling a dinner. That\\'s not going to change anything, but we can be much stronger as it relates to that.\\n\\nAs it relates to Iran, it\\'s not a strategy to tear up an agreement. A strategy would be how do we confront Iran? And, the first thing that we need to do is to establish our commitment to Israel which has been altered by this administration. And, make sure that they have the most sophisticated weapons to send a signal to Iran that we have Israel\\'s back.\\n\\nIf we do that, it\\'s going to create a healthier deterrent effect than anything else I can think of.\\n\\n I don\\'t think \\u2014 you\\'re not stating my views right.\\n\\n I think there needs to be accommodation for someone acting on faith. Religious conscience is \\u2014 is \\u2014 is a first freedom. It\\'s \\u2014 it\\'s a powerful part of our \\u2014 of our Bill of Rights.\\n\\nAnd, in a big, tolerant country, we should respect the rule of law, allow people in \\u2014 in \\u2014 in this country \\u2014 I\\'m a \\u2014 I was opposed to the decision, but we \\u2014 you can\\'t just say, \"well, they \\u2014 gays can\\'t get married now.\"\\n\\nBut this woman, there should be some accommodation for her conscience, just as there should be for people that are florists that don\\'t want to participate in weddings, or bakers. A great country like us should find a way to have accommodations for people so that we can solve the problem in the right way. This should be solved at the local level...\\n\\n And so we do agree, Mike.\\n\\n Well, he\\'s wrong on a lot of things, but on this he\\'s wrong because I\\'m the most pro-life governor on this stage. I got to act on my core beliefs. It\\'s part of who I am. Life is a gift from God. And from beginning end we need to respect it and err on the side of life.\\n\\nAnd so I defunded Planned Parenthood. We created a climate where parental notification took place. We were the only state to fund crisis pregnancy centers with state moneys. We were totally focused on this. And I would bring that kind of philosophy to Washington, D.C.\\n\\nSo here is a solution to this. Title X of the HHS funding, there is something that was the \"Reagan Rule.\" It was passed in 1988. And in that rule it was defined, and the courts approved this, that a Planned Parenthood, you couldn\\'t separate the money between the actual abortion procedures, and there are 330,000 abortions that take place in this clinic, and their promotion of it.\\n\\nHe interpreted it the right way, the courts ruled in his favor, and Planned Parenthood did not get funding during that time until President Clinton came in.\\n\\nWhen I\\'m elected president, we will restore that interpretation of Title X. And this deal will be finished. [applause]\\n\\n There are 13,000 community-based organizations that provide health services to women, 13,000 in this country. I don\\'t believe that Planned Parenthood should get a penny from the federal government. Those organizations should get funding, just as I increased funding when I was governor of the state.\\n\\nThat\\'s the way you do this is you improve the condition for people. And, Donald, when I was governor, we also increased the opportunities for women.\\n\\nWomen\\'s income grew three times faster than the national average when I was governor.\\n\\n We improved \\u2014 we improved \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 we increased child support \\u2014 we increased child support with a broken system by 90 percent.\\n\\n I have a proven record. I have a proven record.\\n\\n He did, he did. You\\'re proud of your family, just as I am.\\n\\n To subject my wife into the middle of a raucous political conversation was completely inappropriate, and I hope you apologize for that, Donald.\\n\\n She is. She\\'s fantastic.\\n\\n She is absolutely the love of my life, and she\\'s right here...\\n\\n And why don\\'t you apologize to her right now.\\n\\n Yeah.\\n\\n So, here\\'s the deal. My wife is a Mexican-American. She\\'s an American by choice.\\n\\nShe loves this country as much as anybody in this room, and she wants a secure border. But she wants to embrace the traditional American values that make us special and make us unique.\\n\\nWe\\'re at a crossroads right now. Are we going to take the Reagan approach, the hopeful optimistic approach, the approach that says that, you come to our country legally, you pursue your dreams with a vengeance, you create opportunities for all of us?\\n\\nOr the Donald Trump approach? The approach that says that everything is bad, that everything is coming to an end. I...\\n\\n I\\'m on the Reagan side of this.\\n\\n Look, first of all, I wrote a book about this, three \\u2014 four years ago, now. And I laid out a comprehensive, conservative approach for immigration reform.\\n\\nAnd it does require securing the border. No one disagrees with that. But to build a wall, and to deport people \\u2014 half a million a month \\u2014 would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, Donald. Hundreds of billions of dollars. It would destroy community life, it would tear families apart.\\n\\nAnd it would send a signal to the rest of the world that the United States values that are so important for our long-term success no longer matter in this country. [applause]\\n\\n Well, I\\'ve been speaking English here tonight, and I\\'ll keep speaking English.\\n\\nBut the simple fact is, if a high school kid asks me a question in Spanish, a school \\u2014 by the way, a voucher program that was created under my watch, the largest voucher program in the country, where kids can go to a Christian school, and they ask me a question in Spanish, I\\'m going to show respect and answer that question in Spanish.\\n\\nEven though they do speak English, and even though they embrace American values. [applause]\\n\\n Yeah.\\n\\n Well, first of all, Hugh, if you\\'re looking at Republican advisers, you have to go to the last two administrations. That happened to be 41 and 43. So just by definition, if you\\'re \\u2014 and many of the people here that are seeking advice from the foreign policy experts in the Republican side, they \\u2014 they served in my dad\\'s administration, my brother\\'s administration. Of course that\\'s the case.\\n\\nBut I\\'m my own man. I\\'m going to create a strategy that is based on the simple fact that the United States needs to lead the world. The first thing that we need to do is to stop the craziness of the sequester.\\n\\nRebuild our military so that our \\u2014 so that we don\\'t deploy people over and over again without the necessary equipment to keep them safe, to send a signal to the world that we\\'re serious. If we\\'re going to lead the world, then we need to have the strongest military possible.\\n\\nWe need to rebuild our counterintelligence and intelligence capabilities. We need to focus on the fact that the next president is going to start in 2017, not in 1990 \\u2014 you know, 30 years ago, or when my brother started.\\n\\nThe world is dramatically different. And I believe that we need to restore America\\'s presence and leadership in the world. Name a country where our relationship is better today than it was the \\u2014 the day that Barack Obama got elected president.\\n\\nUnder Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama, we have seen a weakness that now creates huge problems for the next president of the United States. So I\\'ll have a team that will be \\u2014 that will be following the doctrine I set up, and it will be peace through strength.\\n\\nWe\\'re sitting here in this library, which is a wonderful place to talk about this, because that\\'s exactly what happened in the 1980s, and the world was a lot safer because of...\\n\\n The leadership of Ronald Reagan and my...[crosstalk]\\n\\n So you \\u2014 the \\u2014 the first chance...\\n\\n Right after me, and then I\\'ll \\u2014 I\\'ll yield \\u2014 yield the floor. What do you guys say in the Senate when you\\'re talking and debating?\\n\\n Here\\'s the facts: When Donald Trump talks about judgment, what was his position on who would\\'ve been the best negotiator to deal with Iran? It wasn\\'t a Republican; it was Hillary Clinton. That\\'s what you believe. I mean, the lack of judgment and the lack of understanding about how the world works is really dangerous in this kind of time that we\\'re saying.\\n\\nSo is that the judgment that you bring to the table, that Hillary Clinton...\\n\\n ... is a great negotiator, that she could bring about a better deal on Iran?\\n\\n You know what? As it relates to my brother, there\\'s one thing I know for sure. He kept us safe.\\n\\nI don\\'t know if you remember... [applause] ... Donald... [applause] ... you remember the \\u2014 the rumble? You remember the fire fighter with his arms around it? He sent a clear signal that the United States would be strong and fight Islamic terrorism, and he did keep us safe.\\n\\n That\\'s \\u2014 that\\'s my brother.\\n\\n Here\\'s the lessons of history: When we \\u2014 we pull back, voids are created. We left Iraq. We should\\'ve had a \\u2014 a forces agreement to stay there with a small force, and instead of that, we politically and militarily pulled back, and now we have the creation of ISIS.\\n\\n36 days ago in this very library, I gave a speech with a comprehensive strategy how to take out ISIS, and it requires American leadership and engagement. We don\\'t have to be the world\\'s policemen. But we certainly have to be the world\\'s leader.\\n\\nWe need to have \\u2014 make sure that the world knows that we\\'re serious, that we\\'re engaged, that we\\'re not going to pull back, that \\u2014 that our \\u2014 that our word matters. And if we do that, we can create a force that will take out ISIS both in Iraq and in Syria, which will take a lot longer time now...\\n\\n ... because of what President Obama\\'s done by pulling back.\\n\\n Well, I\\'m surprised Senator Cruz would say that since he was as strong supporter of John Roberts at the time.\\n\\nI will talk about what I will do as it relates to appointing Supreme Court Justices. We need to make sure that we have justices that, with a proven experienced record of respect for upholding the constitution. That is what we need. We can\\'t have \\u2014 the history in recent past is appoint people that have no experience so that you can\\'t get attacked.\\n\\nAnd, that makes it harder for people to have confidence that they won\\'t veer off...\\n\\n John Roberts has made some really good decisions, for sure, but he did not have a proven, extensive record that would have made the clarity the important thing, and that\\'s what we need to do. And, I\\'m willing to fight for those nominees to make sure that they get passed. You can\\'t do it the politically expedient way anymore. This is the culture in Washington. You have to fight hard for these appointments. This is perhaps the most important thing that the next president will do.\\n\\n Well, first of all, he, as I said, supported John Roberts. He supported him, publicly. So, you can rewrite history, I guess, Ted, but the simple fact is that you supported him because he had all the criteria that you would have thought would have made a great justice. And, I think he is doing a good job.\\n\\nBut, the simple fact is that going forward, what we need to do is to have someone that has a long standing set of rulings that consistently makes it clear that he is a focused, exclusively on upholding the Constitution of the United States so they won\\'t try to use the bench as a means to which legislate.\\n\\n He was talking about me.\\n\\n Well, I \\u2014 I wanted to \\u2014 be \\u2014 make it easier for him.\\n\\n And I just did.\\n\\n So, 40 years ago, I smoked marijuana, and I admit it. I\\'m sure that other people might have done it and may not want to say it in front of 25 million people. My mom\\'s not happy that I just did. [laughter and applause]\\n\\nThat\\'s true. And here\\'s the deal. Here\\'s the deal. We have \\u2014 we have a serious epidemic of drugs that goes way beyond marijuana. What goes on in Colorado, as far as I\\'m concerned, that should be a state decision.\\n\\nBut if you look at the problem of drugs in this \\u2014 in this society today, it\\'s a serious problem. Rand, you know this because you\\'re campaigning in New Hampshire like all of us, and you see the epidemic of heroin, the overdoses of heroin that\\'s taking place.\\n\\nPeople\\'s families are \\u2014 are being torn apart. It is appropriate for the government to play a consistent role to be able to provide more treatment, more prevention \\u2014 we\\'re the state that has the most drug courts across every circuit in \\u2014 in \\u2014 in Florida, there are drug courts to give people a second chance.\\n\\nThat\\'s the best way to do this.\\n\\n No, you\\'re wrong \\u2014 you\\'re wrong about this.\\n\\n I don\\'t want to put poor people in jail, Randy.\\n\\n Here\\'s the deal. No, I did not oppose when the legislature passed the bill to deal with that very issue. That\\'s the way to solve this problem.\\n\\nMedical marijuana on the ballot was opened up, there was a huge loophole, it was the first step to getting to a [inaudible] place. And as a citizen of Florida, I voted no.\\n\\n Not very far.\\n\\nI think we need to do this state by state. There are places that get this right, and we need to make sure that we protect the privacy laws. This is a complicated place. But I do think the natural impulse on the left \\u2014 Hillary Clinton, immediately after one of these horrific violent acts took place, immediately said we need to have federal gun laws. President Obama almost reflexively always says the same thing.\\n\\nAnd the net result is, you\\'re going to take away rights of \\u2014 of law-abiding citizens, the 99.999 percent of the people that are law- abiding citizens. That\\'s not the right approach to do it.\\n\\nIn Florida, we have a background check. We have concealed-weapon permit holders, and in fact, there\\'s 1,200,000 of them. We have a reduction in violent crime because we put people behind bars when they use a gun in the commission of the crime. That\\'s the better approach.\\n\\nBut we\\'re living in a society today where despair kind of grows in isolation.\\n\\n I \\u2014 I think there needs to be a hearing, but the fact is, we need to encourage that kind of involvement. That\\'s \\u2014 that\\'s exactly what we need to do.\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n I would go with Ronald Reagan\\'s partner, Margaret Thatcher. Probably illegal, but what the heck? [applause] Since it\\'s not going to happen. A strong leader is what we need in the White House, and she certainly was a strong leader that restored the United Kingdom into greatness.\\n\\n Ever Ready, it\\'s very high energy, Donald. [applause]\\n\\n Six million more people are living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president. Six million more people. The middle class has had declining income, workforce participation rates are lower than they were in 1977.\\n\\nFor the first time in modern history, more businesses are failing than are being created. That is what the next president will have to deal with.\\n\\nAnd I believe we can reverse course by creating a strategy of high sustained economic growth, not the new normal of 2 percent that all the left says we just have to get used to, but a 4 percent growth strategy where we reform how we tax, fix the broken regulatory system, embrace the energy revolution in our midst, fix the immigration system so we can turn it into an economic driver, deal with the structural fiscal problems that exist because of our entitlement problems that will overwhelm and create way too much debt.\\n\\nIf we grow at 4 percent, people are going to be lifted out of poverty. The great middle that defines our country will have a chance to be able to pursue their dreams as they see fit.\\n\\nThat should be the great challenge and the great opportunity for the next president of the United States, to forge consensus to go back to a high-growth strategy. And then we\\'ll be able to lead the world.\\n\\nWithout a high-growth strategy, our country will never have the resources or the optimism to be able to lead the world, which the world desperately needs our leadership. [applause]\\n\\n', ...],\n",
       " u'CARSON': [u\" Well, I could take issue with -- with all of those things, but we don't have time.\\n\\nBut I will say, we have a debate here tonight, and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas, and I'm looking very much forward to demonstrating that, in fact, the thing that is probably most important is having a brain, and to be able to figure things out and learn things very rapidly.\\n\\nSo, you know, experience comes from a large number of different arenas, and America became a great nation early on not because it was flooded with politicians, but because it was flooded with people who understood the value of personal responsibility, hard work, creativity, innovation, and that's what will get us on the right track now, as well.\\n\\n Well, thank you, Megyn, I wasn't sure I was going to get to talk again. [applause]\\n\\n Alright. You know, what we do in order to get the information that we need is our business, and I wouldn't necessarily be broadcasting what we're going to do. [applause]\\n\\nWe. . .uh. . .we've gotten into this -- this mindset of fighting politically correct wars. There is no such thing as a politically correct war. [applause]\\n\\nAnd, the left, of course, will say Carson doesn't believe in the Geneva Convention. Carson doesn't believe in fighting stupid wars. And -- and what we have to remember is we want to utilize the tremendous intellect that we have in the military to win wars.\\n\\nAnd I've talked to a lot of the generals, a lot of our advanced people. And believe me, if we gave them the mission, which is what the commander-in-chief does, they would be able to carry it out.\\n\\nAnd if we don't tie their hands behind their back, they will do it...[timer sounds]...extremely effectively. [applause]\\n\\n What I agree with is that we need a significantly changed taxation system. And the one that I've advocated is based on tithing, because I think God is a pretty fair guy.\\n\\nAnd he said, you know, if you give me a tithe, it doesn't matter how much you made. If you've had a bumper crop, you don't owe me triple tithes. And if you've had no crops at all, you don't owe me no tithes. So there must be something inherently fair about that.\\n\\nAnd that's why I've advocated a proportional tax system. You make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10, you pay one. And everybody gets treated the same way. And you get rid of the deductions, you get rid of all the loopholes, and...[timer sounds]\\n\\n And I have a lot more to say about it.\\n\\n If Hillary is the candidate, which I doubt, that would be a dream come true. [laughter]\\n\\nBut you know, the fact of the matter is, she is the epitome of the progressive -- the secular progressive movement. And she counts on the fact that people are uninformed, the Alinsky Model, taking advantage of useful idiots.\\n\\nWell, I just happen to believe that people are not stupid. [applause] And the way I will come at it is to educate people, help people to actually understand that it is that progressive movement that is causing them the problems.\\n\\nYou know, you look at the -- the national debt and how it's being driven up. If I was trying to destroy this country, what I would do is find a way to drive wedges between all the people, drive the debt to an unsustainable level, and then step off the stage as a world leader and let our enemies increase while we decreased our capacity as a military person. And that's what she's doing. [applause]\\n\\n Well, what we have to stop and think about is that we have weakened ourselves militarily to such an extent that if affects all of our military policies. Our Navy is at its smallest size since 1917; our Air Force, since 1940. In recent testimony, the commandant of the Marine Corps said half of the non-deployed units were not ready and you know, the sequester is cutting the heart out of our personnel. Our generals are retiring because they don't want to be part of this, and at the same time, our enemies are increasing.\\n\\nOur -- our friends can't trust us anymore. You know, Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state. They gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them. We won't even give them offensive weapons.\\n\\nYou know, we turned our back on Israel, our ally. You know, in a situation like that, of course Obama's not going to be able to do anything. I would shore up our military first, because if you don't get the military right, nothing else is going to work. [applause]\\n\\n Well, I think the bully pulpit is a wonderful place to start healing that divide. You know, we have the purveyors of hatred who take every single incident between people of two races and try to make a race war out of it, and drive wedges into people. And this does not need to be done.\\n\\nWhat we need to think about instead -- you know, I was asked by an NPR reporter once, why don't I talk about race that often. I said it's because I'm a neurosurgeon. And she thought that was a strange response. And you say -- I said, you see, when I take someone to the operating room, I'm actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are. The skin doesn't make them who they are. The hair doesn't make them who they are. And it's time for us to move beyond that. [applause]\\n\\nBecause...[applause]...our strength as a nation comes in our unity. We are the United States of America, not the divided states. And those who want to destroy us are trying to divide us, and we shouldn't let them do it. [applause]\\n\\n Well, I haven't said anything about me being the only one to do anything, so let me try that.\\n\\nI'm the only one to separate Siamese twins...[laughter]\\n\\nThe -- the only one to operate on babies while they were still in mother's womb, the only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it. [laughter]\\n\\nBut I -- but I'm very hopeful that I'm not the only one who's willing to pick up the baton of freedom, because freedom is not free, and we must fight for it every day. Every one of us must fight for it, because we're fighting for our children and the next generation. [applause]\\n\\n\", u' Hi, I\\'m Ben Carson, and I\\'m a retired pediatric neurosurgeon. I\\'m here with my wife, Candy, of 40 years, and two of my sons, and their wives.\\n\\nI stress the pediatric part of my career because the reason that I\\'ve gotten involved in this race is because I\\'m very concerned about the future of our children, and the direction of our country is one that does not portend well, unless we, the people, intervene and retake our rightful place at the pinnacle. [applause]\\n\\n Typically, politicians do things that are politically expedient. And they are looking for whatever their particular goal is.\\n\\nThat is not the reason that I have gotten into this thing. I\\'m extraordinary concerned about the direction of this country, the divisiveness that is going on, fiscal irresponsibility, the failure to take a leadership position in the world.\\n\\nAll of those things will lead to a situation where the next generation will not have a chance that we\\'ve had now. So I don\\'t \\u2014 I don\\'t want to really get into describing who\\'s a politician and who\\'s not a politician, but I think the people have kind of made that decision for themselves already, and will continue to do so as time goes on.\\n\\n Jake, can I say something about that?\\n\\n You know, when I entered this race, all the political pundits said it\\'s impossible; you can\\'t do it because you\\'re not connected with the money. And there\\'s no way that you can raise what you need in order to compete successfully.\\n\\nI in no way am willing to get in the bed with special interest group or lick the boots of billionaires. I have said to the people if they want me to do this, please get involved. And we now have over 500,000 donations, and the money is coming in.\\n\\nBut the pundits forgot about one thing, and that is the people. And they are really in charge.\\n\\n Well, first of all, I recognize that we have an incredible illegal immigration problem. I was down in Arizona a few weeks ago at the border. I mean, the fences that were there were not manned, and those are the kind of fences when I was a kid that would barely slow us down. So, I don\\'t see any purpose in having that.\\n\\nNow, what we need to do is look at something that actually works. Yuma County, Arizona. They stop 97 percent of the illegal immigrants through there. They put in a double fence with a road so that there was quick access by the enforcement people.\\n\\nIf we don\\'t seal the border, the rest of this stuff clearly doesn\\'t matter. It\\'s kind of ridiculous all the other things we talk about. We have the ability to do it, we don\\'t have the will to do it.\\n\\nThere was one area where they had cut a hole in the fence, and to repair it, they put a few strands of barb wire across. Well, the photographers who were there with us, they wanted to photograph us from the side of the Mexicans, and they went through there, and they were not physically fit people, and they took their cameras and things with them, and shot us from the other side.\\n\\nThat\\'s how easy it is to get across. And, the drugs, I mean, it goes on, and on, and on. ICE tells them to release these people, 67,000 criminals released...\\n\\n ...on to our property, it\\'s ridiculous.\\n\\n Well, I have also said, if anybody knows how to do that, that I would be willing to listen. And, if they can, you know, specify exactly how that\\'s going to be done, and what the cost, and it sounds reasonable, then I think it\\'s worth discussing...\\n\\nTRUMP(?): ...[inaudible]...\\n\\n Not exactly what I said.\\n\\n Well, what I said, after we seal the borders, after we turn off the spigot that dispenses all the goodies so we don\\'t have people coming in here, including employment, that people who had a pristine record, we should consider allowing them to become guest workers, primarily in the agricultural sphere, because that\\'s the place where Americans don\\'t seem to want to work.\\n\\nThat\\'s what I said. And they have a six-month period to do that. If they don\\'t do it within that time period, then they become illegal, and as illegals, they will be treated as such.\\n\\n Can I \\u2014 can I \\u2014 can I just...\\n\\n Can I correct...\\n\\n OK.\\n\\n My plan is not amnesty for a number of reasons.\\n\\nNumber one, you know, I\\'ve talked to farmers, and they said they cannot hire Americans to do the kind of job that I\\'m talking about.\\n\\nAnd the second reason is because the individuals who register as guest workers, they don\\'t get to vote, they are not American citizens, and they don\\'t get the rights and privileges of American citizens. So that\\'s key.\\n\\nBut the other thing that I want to bring up is, I mentioned something earlier. I think it was just sort of glossed over.\\n\\nI talked about the success in Yuma County, I mean, incredible success, and the Department of Justice said, \"No, we don\\'t want to do that. That\\'s too successful.\"\\n\\nWe don\\'t have to keep reinventing the wheel. All we have to do is look at things that work. All we have to do is use a little common sense.\\n\\n It\\'s all about America. You know, the people who say the guy who paid a billion dollars because he had 10, he has still got $9 billion left, that\\'s not fair, we need to take more of his money. That\\'s called socialism. That doesn\\'t work so well.\\n\\nWhat made America into a great nation was the fact that we said, that guy just put in $1 billion, let\\'s create an environment that\\'s even more conducive to his success so that next year he can put in $2 billion.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s the kind of thing that helps us to grow. We can\\'t grow by continuing to take a piece of pie, and dividing it, and redistributing it.\\n\\nBut, I\\'m also looking at what doctor \\u2014 at what Governor Huckabee talked about...\\n\\n The Fair Tax. Looking at both of them, and evaluating them both, and I\\'m talking to the American people because one of the things we must recognize is that this country is of, for, and by the people. And, it\\'s really time that the government get out of the way, and let the people be the ones who decide how they want to run their country. [applause]\\n\\n Well, first of all, let me say what I actually said about raising the minimum wage. I was asked should it be raised, I said, probably, or possibly. But, what I added, which I think is the most important thing, so, I said we need to get both sides of this issue to sit down, and talk about it. Negotiate a reasonable minimum wage, and index that so that we never have to have this conversation again in the history of America.\\n\\nI think we also have to have two minimum wages, a starter, and a sustaining because how are young people ever going to get a job if you have such a high minimum wage that it makes it impractical to hire them...\\n\\n Jake, Jake...\\n\\n I haven\\'t had an opportunity to weigh in on foreign policy, and I just want to mention that when the war, when the issue occurred in 2003, I suggested to President Bush that he not go to war? OK. So I just want that on the record.\\n\\nAnd, you know, a lot of people are very much against us getting involved right now with global jihadism. And they refer back to our invasion of Iraq. And they seem to think that that was what caused it.\\n\\nWhat caused it was withdrawing from there and creating a vacuum which allowed this terrible situation to occur. But it is very different from what is going on today. We\\'re talking about global jihadists who actually want to destroy us.\\n\\nThey are an existential threat to our nation. And we have to be mature enough to recognize that our children will have no future if we put our heads in the sand. We have to recognize we have two choices.\\n\\nWe either allow them the continue to progress and appear to be the winners, or we use every resource available to us to destroy...\\n\\n ... them first.\\n\\n Well, recognize that, you know, President George W. Bush is a great friend of ours, and we spent many wonderful days at the White House. I haven\\'t been there in the last seven years. I probably have to have a food-tester. [laughter]\\n\\nBut at any rate, I didn\\'t suggest that nothing be done. What I suggested to President Bush is to be Kennedy-esque, in the sense that when the Russians got ahead of us in the space race, what we did is use the bully pulpit to galvanize everybody, business, industry, academia behind a national goal to put a man on the moon and bring him back safely.\\n\\nI said, you can do the same kind of thing. Declare that within five to 10 years we will become petroleum independent. The moderate Arab states would have been so concerned about that, they would have turned over Osama bin Laden and anybody else you wanted on a silver platter within two weeks.\\n\\nThere are smart ways to do things and there are muscular ways to do things. And sometimes you have to look at both of those to come up with the right solution.\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n I have no argument with having a strong leader, and to be aggressive where aggression is needed. But it is not needed in every circumstance. There is a time when you can use your intellect to come up with other ways to do things. And I think that\\'s what we have to start thinking about.\\n\\nThere is no question that a lot of these problems that we have been talking about in terms of the international situation is because we are weak. It is because our Navy is so small. It is because our Air Force is incapable of doing the same things that it did a few years ago.\\n\\nIt\\'s because our Marines Corps is not ready to be deployed.\\n\\n There are a lot of problems that are going on, and we need to solve those problems, we need to build up our military...\\n\\n Well, let me put it this way, there has \\u2014 there have been numerous studies, and they have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism.\\n\\nThis was something that was spread widely 15 or 20 years ago, and it has not been adequately, you know, revealed to the public what\\'s actually going on. Vaccines are very important. Certain ones. The ones that would prevent death or crippling.\\n\\nThere are others, there are a multitude of vaccines which probably don\\'t fit in that category, and there should be some discretion in those cases. But, you know, a lot of this is \\u2014 is \\u2014 is pushed by big government.\\n\\nAnd I think that\\'s one of the things that people so vehemently want to get rid of, big government. You know, we have 4.1 million federal employees. Six hundred and fifty federal agencies and department (sic).\\n\\nThat\\'s why they have to take so much of our taxes.\\n\\n Well, you know, I\\'ve just explained it to him. He can read about it if he wants to. I think he\\'s an intelligent man and will make the correct decision after getting the real facts.\\n\\n He\\'s an OK doctor. [laughter and applause] But, you know, the fact of the matter is, we have extremely well-documented proof that there\\'s no autism associated with vaccinations. But it is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time.\\n\\nAnd a lot of pediatricians now recognize that, and, I think, are cutting down on the number and the proximity in which those are done, and I think that\\'s appropriate.\\n\\n I\\'d put my mother on there. You know, she was one of 24 children, got married at age 13, had only a third grade education, had to raise two sons by herself, refused to be a victim. Wouldn\\'t let us be victims, and has been an inspiration to many people. [applause]\\n\\n One Nation.\\n\\n Well, you know, I was a radical Democrat before I started listening to Ronald Reagan. And he didn\\'t sound like what they said Republicans were.\\n\\nHe sounded logical. And I hope that I sound logical also. Because when I look at what is going on with the United States of America, I see a lot of things that are not logical.\\n\\nI see us allowing people to divide us, when in fact our strength is in our unity. I see people exercising the most irresponsible fiscal habits that anyone could possibly do. And hiding it from the American people, so that the majority of people have no idea what our financial situation is.\\n\\nSo, when someone comes along and says, free college, free phones, free this and that, and the other, they say, \"wow, that\\'s nice,\" having no idea that they\\'re destabilizing our position. And I think also that Ronald Reagan was a master at understanding that a pinnacle nation has to be a nation that leads.\\n\\nIf we learn to lead in the Middle East right now, a coalition will form behind us, but never they do it if we just sit there and talk about it.\\n\\nReal leadership is what I would hopefully bring to America.

       " u'CAVUTO': [u'', u'', u'', ...],\n",
       " u'CHRISTIE': [u' If you think it\\'s bad now, you should\\'ve seen it when I got there. [laught and applause]\\n\\nThe fact is -- the fact is, in the eight years before I became governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times. In the eight years before I became governor, spending was increased 56 percent. And in the eight years before I become governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times.\\n\\nIn the eight years before I became Governor, spending was increased 56 percent, and in the eight years before I became governor, there was zero net private sector job growth in New Jersey. Zero. For eight years.\\n\\nSo, what did we do? We came in, we balanced an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget by cutting over 800 programs in the state budget. We brought the budget into balance with no tax increases. In fact, we vetoed five income tax increases during my time as governor. We cut business taxes $2.3 billion, and we cut regulation by one-third of what my predecessor put in place.\\n\\nAnd, what\\'s happened since? A hundred ninety-two thousand private sector jobs in the five and a half years I\\'ve been governor. We have a lot of work to do in New Jersey, but I am darn proud we\\'ve brought our state back. [applause]\\n\\n Yes, I do. And I\\'ll tell you why: because I\\'m the only person on this stage who\\'s actually filed applications under the Patriot Act, who has gone before the federal -- the Foreign Intelligence Service court, who has prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after September 11th.\\n\\nI was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on September 10th, 2001, and the world changed enormously the next day, and that happened in my state.\\n\\nThis is not theoretical to me. I went to the funerals. We lost friends of ours in the Trade Center that day. My own wife was two blocks from the Trade Center that day, at her office, having gone through it that morning.\\n\\nWhen you actually have to be responsible for doing this, you can do it, and we did it, for seven years in my office, respecting civil liberties and protecting the homeland.\\n\\nAnd I will make no apologies, ever, for protecting the lives and the safety of the American people. We have to give more tools to our folks to be able to do that, not fewer, and then trust those people and oversee them to do it the right way. As president, that is exactly what I\\'ll do.\\n\\n And -- and, Megyn? Megyn, that\\'s a -- that, you know, that\\'s a completely ridiculous answer. \"I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from other people.\" How are you supposed to know, Megyn?\\n\\n What are you supposed to...\\n\\n ...how are you supposed to -- no, I\\'ll tell you how you, look...\\n\\n Let me tell you something, you go...\\n\\n When you -- you know, senator...\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n Listen, senator, you know, when you\\'re sitting in a subcommittee, just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that. [applause]\\n\\nWhen you\\'re responsible for protecting the lives of the American people, then what you need to do is to make sure...\\n\\n ...is to make sure that you use the system the way it\\'s supposed to work.\\n\\n There is no...\\n\\n And you know -- you know, Senator Paul? Senator Paul, you know, the hugs that I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families who lost their people on September 11th.\\n\\nThose are the hugs I remember, and those had nothing to do -- and those had nothing to do with politics, unlike what you\\'re doing by cutting speeches on the floor of the Senate, then putting them on the Internet within half an hour to raise money for your campaign...\\n\\n ...and while still putting our country at risk.\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n You know what, Megyn, can I...\\n\\n No, he\\'s not lying, he\\'s just wrong.\\n\\nI mean, so, there\\'s a difference -- I\\'m the only guy on this stage who\\'s put out a detailed, 12 point plan on entitlement reform and here\\'s why -- because 71% of federal spending right now is on entitlements, and debt service, 71%. And we have spent the last hour and five minutes talking about the other 29%, and no time on the 71%, and that makes no sense.\\n\\nNow, let me tell you exactly what we would do on Social Security. Yes, we\\'d raise the retirement age two years, and phase it in over 25 years, that means we\\'d raise it one month a year for 25 years when we\\'re all living longer, and living better lives.\\n\\nSecondly, we would means test Social Security for those who are making over $200,000 dollars a year in retirement income, and have $4 to $5 million dollars in liquid assets saved. They don\\'t need that Social Security check. Social Security is meant to be -- to make sure that no one who\\'s worked hard, and played by the rules, and paid into the system grows old in poverty in America.\\n\\nIf we don\\'t deal with this problem, it will bankrupt our country, or lead to massive tax increases, neither one that we want in this country. [applause]\\n\\n Chris...\\n\\n Yeah, sure. And, I don\\'t disagree with ending Congress\\' retirement program. I\\'m a governor, I don\\'t have a retirement program in my state, and I don\\'t disagree with that. But, here\\'s the news to the American people, he\\'s complaining about the lying and stealing. The lying and stealing has already occurred. The trust fund is filled with IOU\\'s. We can\\'t fix the problem just by ending Congress\\'s retirement, that\\'s worth about, \"this\" much.\\n\\nWe need to go at the fundamental problem, and the fundamental problem is that this system is broken. It has been stolen from. We have been lied to, [timer sounds] and we need a strong leader to tell the truth and fix...\\n\\n Well, listen.\\n\\nYou know, if we want to deal with these issues, we have to deal with them in a way that makes sense.\\n\\nI agree with what Dr. Carson said earlier. The first thing we need to do to make America stronger is to strengthen our military, and I put out a really specific plan: no less than 500,000 active duty soldiers in the Army. No less than 185,000 active duty marines in the Marine Corps. Bring us to a 350 ship Navy again, and modernize the Ohio class of submarines, and bring our Air Force back to 2,600 aircraft that are ready to go.\\n\\nThose are the kind of things that are going to send a clear message around the world. Those are the things that we need to start working on immediately to make our country stronger and make it better. Those are the things that we need to be able to be doing. And as we move towards dealing with foreign aid, I don\\'t disagree with Senator Paul\\'s position that we shouldn\\'t be funding our enemies. But I absolutely believe that Israel is a priority to be able to fund and keep them strong and safe after eight years of this administration. [applause]\\n\\n Well, thank you, Megyn. Listen, I was born into a middle class family in New Jersey. My dad came home from serving in the Army after having lost his father, worked in the Breyers ice cream plant in Newark, New Jersey. Was the first person to graduate from college. He put himself through college at night. My mom was a secretary.\\n\\nI was appointed United States attorney on September 10, 2001. And I spent the next seven years of my career fighting terrorism and putting terrorists in jail.\\n\\nI\\'m a conservative, pro-life governor in a state where it is really tough to be both. A state like New Jersey, with lots of Democrats, but still we cut taxes, we balanced budgets. We fought [timer sounds] the teacher\\'s union.\\n\\nThis president has had weak leadership, which has led to bad choices. We have got to stop worrying about being loved and start worrying about being respected. And that\\'s exactly how I\\'ll lead our country. [applause]\\n\\n', u' Hi, my name is Chris Christie, and I\\'d like to you take the camera off me and put it on the audience because I\\'d like to ask all of you, how many of you, raise your hand, believe that in today\\'s Barak Obama America your children will have a better life than you\\'ve had?\\n\\nYou see? That\\'s why I\\'m running for President. because leadership is not about me, it\\'s about our country. And, what we talk about tonight, it\\'s not about us, it\\'s about the people in the audience tonight, because in seven short years this president has stripped away their trust, and their faith, and their belief that the next generation will have a better life. He\\'s stolen that from us, and when I\\'m president, I\\'m going to take it back. [applause]\\n\\n Well, I know Ben wasn\\'t talking about me, I\\'m sure he was talking about one of the other guys, not me. [laughter]\\n\\nAs far as being an outsider is concerned \\u2014 as far as being an outsider is concerned, let me tell you this, Jake, I\\'m a Republican in New Jersey. I wake up every morning as an outsider. I wake up every morning with a Democratic legislature who trying to beat my head in and fight me because I\\'m trying to bring conservative change to a state that needed it desperately.\\n\\nAnd so, everyone can talk us here about their credentials. But the bottom line is, every morning I get up, I veto 400 bills from a crazy liberal Democratic legislature, not one of them has been overridden. I\\'ve vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history, according to Americans for Tax Reform.\\n\\nWhat folks want in this country is somebody to go down there and get the job done. And that\\'s exactly what I\\'ll do.\\n\\nSo, I know this much, that what the American people want to hire right now is somebody who believes in them. And believes that they are the ones who can fix our country. I will be the vessel through which they can fix this country, but it\\'s not about me.\\n\\nIt\\'s about all of you. And getting this government off your back and out of your way, and letting you succeed. I know Ben wasn\\'t talking about me.\\n\\n Look at him smiling at me right now. I know Ben didn\\'t mean it about me. One of these other guys, I\\'m sure.\\n\\n Be honest, Ben, be honest.\\n\\n See, Jake, it wasn\\'t me. [laughter]\\n\\n I was \\u2014\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n She is, and so if she, based on conscience, can\\'t sign that \\u2014 that marriage license, then there should be someone in her office to be able to do it, and if the law needs to be changed in the state of Kentucky, which is what she\\'s advocating, it should be changed.\\n\\n And why don\\'t we do the same thing with Planned Parenthood?\\n\\n We elected a Republican Congress to do this. And they should be doing it, and they\\'re not. And they\\'re giving the president a pass.\\n\\n I put it in the list, Dana. We should be doing these things and forcing the president to take action.\\n\\n Let\\'s force him to do what he says he\\'s going to do. Now I don\\'t know whether he\\'ll do it or not, but let\\'s force him to do it.\\n\\n First of, Jake, I don\\'t yield to anybody on how to enforce the law. I\\'m the only person on this stage who spent seven years as a United States Attorney after September 11th, and I know how to do this.\\n\\nThe fact is though that for 15,000 people a day to be deported every day for two years is an undertaking that almost none of us could accomplish given the current levels of funding, and the current number of law enforcement officers. Here\\'s what we need to do, and I think this is where Donald is absolutely right. What we need to do is to secure our border, and we need to do it with more than just a wall.\\n\\nWe need to use electronics, we need to use drones, we need to use FBI, DEA, and ATF, and yes, we need to take the fingerprint of every person who comes into this country on a visa, and when they overstay their visa, we need to tap them on the shoulder, and say, \"You have overstayed your welcome, you\\'re taking advantage of the American people. It\\'s time for you to go.\"\\n\\nIf we had that kind of system in place, we wouldn\\'t have the 11 million people we have now.\\n\\n Jake listen. While I\\'m as entertained as anyone by this personal back-and-forth about the history of Donald and Carly\\'s career, for the 55-year-old construction worker out in that audience tonight who doesn\\'t have a job, who can\\'t fund his child\\'s education, I\\'ve got to tell you the truth. They could care less about your careers, they care about theirs. [applause]\\n\\nLet\\'s start talking about that on this stage and stop playing \\u2014 and stop playing the games. Stop playing \\u2014\\n\\n John \\u2014 I\\'m not done yet, John.\\n\\n Stop \\u2014 and stop playing \\u2014 and Carly \\u2014 Carly, listen. You can interrupt everybody else on this stage, you\\'re not going to interrupt me, OK?\\n\\nThe fact is that we don\\'t want to hear about your careers, back and forth and volleying back and forth about who did well and who did poorly. You\\'re both successful people. Congratulations. You know who\\'s not successful? The middle class in this country who\\'s getting plowed over by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Let\\'s start talking about those issues tonight and stop this childish back-and-forth between the two of you. [applause]\\n\\n Listen, you know, Hugh, it\\'s an important point. And the question is, who is going to prosecute Hillary Clinton?\\n\\nThe Obama White House seems to have in interest, the Justice Department seems to have no interest. I think it\\'s time to put a former federal prosecutor on the same stage as Hillary Clinton. [applause]\\n\\nAnd I will prosecute her during those debates on that stage for the record we\\'re talking about here. The fact she had a private email server in her basement, using national security secrets running through it, could have been hacked by the Russians, the Chinese, or two 18-year-olds on a toot (ph) wanting to have some fun.\\n\\nNo one is answering that question from the Hillary Clinton campaign...\\n\\n You know why? Because she knows she\\'s wrong, and she cannot look in the mirror at herself, and she cannot tell the American people the truth.\\n\\n Well, Jake, I was named U.S. attorney by President Bush on September 10th, 2001. And that next day my wife Mary Pat did what she did every day, she traveled through the World Trade Center and went to her office two blocks from the World Trade Center.\\n\\nAnd after those planes hit, for five-and-a-half-hours after that, I couldn\\'t reach her, didn\\'t know whether she was dead or alive, and we had three children at the time, 8, 5 and 1.\\n\\nAnd I had to confront what so many thousands of others in my region had to confront, the idea I might become a single parent, the idea that my life and my children\\'s life might be changed forever.\\n\\nWe lost friends that day. We went to the funerals. And I will tell you that what those people wanted and what they deserved was for America to answer back against what had been done to them.\\n\\nAnd I support what President Bush did at that time, going into Afghanistan, hunting al Qaeda and its leaders, getting its sanctuary out of place, and making it as difficult around the world for them to move people and money.\\n\\nAnd then he went to prosecutors like us, and he said, never again. Don\\'t prosecute these people after the crime is committed. Intervene before the crime happens. I absolutely believe that what the president did at the time was right.\\n\\nAnd I am proud to have been one of the people on the stage who was part of making sure that what Governor Bush said before was the truth. America was safe for those seven years and Barack Obama has taken that safety away from us. [applause]\\n\\n Let me say this, Jake, is that while that may have been a fine idea that Dr. Carson had, these people were out to kill us.\\n\\nI stood in that region with my family, and every time a plane went overhead in the weeks after that, people\\'s heads jerked to the sky because they thought it was happening again.\\n\\nYou do not need to go through subtle diplomacy at that point. That could be handled later on. What you need is a strong American leader who will take the steps that are necessary to protect our nation.\\n\\nThat\\'s what I would do as commander-in-chief in this circumstance. And that\\'s what President George W. Bush did in 2001. [applause]\\n\\n Jake, you brought my issue up.\\n\\n You know, I enjoy the interplay. Thank you, gentlemen.\\n\\nI\\'ll just say this, first off, New Jersey is the first state in the nation that now says if you are non-violent, non-dealing drug user, that you don\\'t go to jail for your first offense. You go to mandatory treatment.\\n\\nYou see, Jake, I\\'m pro-life. And I think you need to be pro-life for more than just the time in the womb. It gets tougher when they get out of the womb. And when they\\'re the 16-year-old drug addict in the Florida county lockup, that life is just as precious as the life in the womb.\\n\\nAnd so, that\\'s why I\\'m for rehabilitation, why I think the war on drugs has been a failure.\\n\\nBut I\\'ll end with this. That doesn\\'t mean we should be legalizing gate way drugs. And if Senator Paul thinks that the only victim is the person, look at the decrease in productivity, look at the way people get used and move on to other drugs when they use marijuana as a gateway drug, it is not them that are the only victims. Their families are the victims too, their children are the victims too, and their employers are the victims also.\\n\\nThat\\'s why I\\'ll enforce the federal law, while you can still put an emphasis on rehabilitation, which we\\'ve done in New Jersey.\\n\\n And Senator Paul knows that that\\'s simply not the truth.\\n\\nIn New Jersey, we have medical marijuana laws, which I supported and implemented. This is not medical marijuana. There\\'s goes as much \\u2014 a further step beyond. This is recreational use of marijuana.\\n\\nThis is much different. And so, while he would like to use a sympathetic story to back up his point, it doesn\\'t work. I\\'m not against medical marijuana. We do it in New Jersey. But I\\'m against the recreational use against marijuana.\\n\\nIf he wants to change the federal law, get Congress to pass the law to change it, and get a president to sign it.\\n\\n No, it\\'s not. But with Donald, it\\'s a good start. That\\'s really good. [laughter]\\n\\nNo, listen. This is an issue that \\u2014 that we\\'ve gotta talk about, and we haven\\'t talked about yet.\\n\\n71 percent of all federal spending is on entitlements and debt service. When John Kennedy was elected president in 1960, it was 26 percent.\\n\\nHarvard and Dartmouth says that Social Security\\'s going to go insolvent in seven to eight years. So what I say is very simple. We need to save this program for the good people out there who have paid into the system and need it.\\n\\nAnd if that means making sure that folks like Donald and many of us on the stage don\\'t get it, that\\'s the right thing to do because here\\'s what Hillary Clinton is going to want to do.\\n\\nShe\\'s going to want to put more money into a system that has already lied to us and stolen from us. This government doesn\\'t need more money to make Social Security solvent. We need to be not paying out benefits to people who don\\'t really need it.\\n\\nWe need to protect the people who Social Security means the difference between picking between heat and rent and food. That\\'s why I put out the proposal and that\\'s the people I\\'m trying to...[crosstalk]\\n\\n I don\\'t think Senator Rubio is a skeptic of climate change. I think what Senator Rubio said I agree with. That in fact we don\\'t need this massive government intervention to deal with the problem.\\n\\nLook at what we have done in New Jersey. We have already reached our clean air goals for 2020. And when I was governor, I pulled out of the regional cap and trade deal, the only state in the Northeast that did that. And we still reached our goals.\\n\\nWhy? Because 53 percent of our electricity comes from nuclear. We use natural gas. We use solar power. We\\'re the third-highest- using solar power state. You know why? Because we made all of those things economically feasible.\\n\\nI agree with Marco. We shouldn\\'t be destroying our economy in order to chase some wild left-wing idea that somehow us by ourselves is going to fix the climate. We can contribute to that and be economically sound.\\n\\nWe have proven we can do that in New Jersey. Nuclear needs to be back on the table in a significant way in this country if we want to go after this problem. [applause]\\n\\n I understand. No, no, listen, everybody makes a mistake every once in a while, Jake, even George Shultz. And if that\\'s truly a representation of what he believes we should be doing, then with all due respect to the former secretary of state, I disagree with him.\\n\\n I think the Adams family has been shorted in the currency business. Our country wouldn\\'t be here without John Adams, and he would not have been able to do it without Abigal Adams, so, I\\'d put Abigail Adams on the bill. [applause]\\n\\n You know, I\\'ve been called a lot of names by a lot of different people, and now I got to get called by names by the Secret Service?\\n\\nI would just say True Heart.\\n\\n I turned 18 in 1980, and my first vote was for Ronald Reagan. Boy, am I glad I did it. And I think the country is, too. A Christie presidency won\\'t be about me. It will be about you.\\n\\nTonight, you sit at home in your living room, frustrated that you play by the rules, you pay the taxes, you do the hard things to raise your family, yet you feel like America\\'s generosity is being taken advantage of. That you\\'ve been \\u2014 system is being gamed, and that you\\'re turning out to fall further and further behind.\\n\\nOur presidency \\u2014 our presidency \\u2014 will be about ending that, about enforcing the law, level the playing field for everybody, and once again reward those folks who play by the rules, and think that justice means more than just the word. But it means a way of life.\\n\\nAnd I will tell you this, around the world, I will not shake hands with, I will not meet with, and I will not agree to anything with a country that says death to us and death to Israel and holds our hostages while we sign agreements with them.\\n\\nIt will be an America that be strong and resolute, and will once again be able to stick out its chest and say, \"we truly are the greatest nation in the world, because we live our lives that way, each and every day.\" [applause]\\n\\n', ...],\n",

[applause]\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for someone to go to Washington, to go along to get along, to get -- to agree with the career politicians in both parties who get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests, then I ain\\'t your guy.\\n\\nThere is a reason... [applause] .... that we have $18 trillion in debt. Because as conservatives, as Republicans, we keep winning elections. We got a Republican House, we\\'ve got a Republican Senate, and we don\\'t have leaders who honor their commitments. I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would do. [applause]\\n\\n Chris, absolutely yes. And not only will I support it...[applause]...I have authored Kate\\'s law in the United States Senate and filed that legislation. I tried to get the Senate to vote to pass Kate\\'s law on the floor of the Senate just one week ago, and the leader of our own party blocked a vote on Kate\\'s law.\\n\\nYou know, there was reference made to our leaders being stupid. It\\'s not a question of stupidity. It\\'s that they don\\'t want to enforce the immigration laws. That there are far too many in the Washington cartel that support amnesty.\\n\\nPresident Obama has talked about fundamentally transforming this country. There\\'s 7 billion people across the face of the globe, many of whom want to come to this country. If they come legally, great. But if they come illegally and they get amnesty, that is how we fundamentally change this country, and it really is striking.\\n\\nA majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty. I have never supported amnesty, and I led the fight against Chuck Schumer\\'s gang of eight amnesty legislation in the Senate.\\n\\n Megyn, we need a commander in chief that speaks the truth. We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words, \"radical Islamic terrorism\". [applause]\\n\\nWhen I asked General Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs, what would be required militarily to destroy ISIS, he said there is no military solution. We need to change the conditions on the ground so that young men are not in poverty and susceptible to radicalization. That, with all due respect, is nonsense.\\n\\nIt\\'s the same answer the State Department gave that we need to give them jobs. What we need is a commander in chief who makes -- clear, if you join ISIS, if you wage jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant.\\n\\n Megyn, of course it\\'s an ideological problem, that\\'s one of the reasons I introduce the Expatriate Terrorist Act in the Senate that said if any American travels to the Middle East and joining ISIS, that he or she forfeits their citizenship so they don\\'t use a passport to come back and wage jihad on Americans. [applause]\\n\\nYes, it is ideological, and let me contrast President Obama, who at the prayer breakfast, essentially acted as an apologist. He said, \"Well, gosh, the crusades, the inquisitions--\"[timer sounds]\\n\\nWe need a president that shows the courage that Egypt\\'s President al-Sisi did, a Muslim, when he called out the radical Islamic terrorists who are threatening the world. [applause]\\n\\n Well, Bret, of course they have, and over the last six and a half years we\\'ve seen the consequences of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy. Leading from behind is a disaster. We have abandoned and alienated our friends and allies, and our enemies are stronger. Radical Islam is on the rise, Iran\\'s on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon, China is waging cyber warfare against America, Russia -- General Soleimani, you just mentioned, the Iranian general is the head of the al Quds forces.\\n\\nHe\\'s directly responsible for the murder of over 500 American servicemen in Iraq, and part of this Iranian deal was lifting the international sanctions on General Soleimani. The day General Soleimani flew back from Moscow to Iran was the day we believed that Russia used cyber warfare against the Joint Chiefs. We need a new commander in chief that will stand up to our enemies, and that will have credibility... [applause]\\n\\nIt is worth emphasizing that Iran released our hostages in 1981 the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. [applause]\\n\\n Brett, can I -- Brett, can I jump in on this one?\\n\\n Well, I am blessed to receive a word from God every day in receiving the scriptures and reading the scriptures. And God speaks through the Bible. [applause]\\n\\nI\\'m the son of a pastor and evangelist and I\\'ve described many times how my father, when I was a child, was an alcoholic. He wasn\\'t a Christian. And my father left my mother and left me when I was just three years old.\\n\\nAnd someone invited him to Clay Road Baptist Church. And he gave his heart to Jesus and it turned him around. And he got on a plane and he flew back to my mother and me. [applause]\\n\\nI would also note that the scripture tells us, \"you shall know them by their fruit.\" We see lots of \"campaign conservatives.\" But if we\\'re going to win in 2016, we need a consistent conservative, someone who has been a fiscal conservative, a social conservative, a national security conservative.\\n\\nThere are real differences among the candidates on issues like amnesty, like Obamacare, like religious liberty, like life and marriage. And I have been proud to fight and stand for religious liberty, to stand against Planned Parenthood, to defend life for my entire career.\\n\\nAnd I will be proud to continue to do so as president of the United States.\\n\\n[cheering and applause]\\n\\n If I\\'m elected president, let me tell you about my first day in office. The first thing I intend to do is to rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama. [applause]\\n\\nThe next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into these videos and to prosecute Planned Parenthood for any criminal violations. [applause]\\n\\nThe next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice and the IRS to start (sic) persecuting religious liberty, and then intend to cancel the Iran deal, and finally move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. [applause]\\n\\nI will keep my word. My father fled Cuba, and I will fight to defend liberty because my family knows what it\\'s like to lose it.\\n\\n', u' I\\'m Ted Cruz. I am the son of an Irish-Italian mom and a Cuban immigrant dad who fled oppression and came to America seeking freedom. I\\'m a husband to my best friend, Heidi, who\\'s here tonight. I\\'m a dad to two little girls who are the loves of my life, Caroline and Catherine.\\n\\nIf you\\'re fed up with Washington, if you\\'re looking for someone to stand up to career politicians in both parties, I\\'m the only one on this stage who has done that over and over again, and if we stand together, we can bring America back.\\n\\n Well, let me tell you, Jake, the single biggest national security threat facing America right now is the threat of a nuclear Iran. We\\'ve seen six and a half years of President Obama leading from behind. Weakness is provocative, and this Iranian nuclear deal is nothing short of catastrophic.\\n\\nThis deal, on its face, will send over $100 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, making the Obama administration the world\\'s leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism.\\n\\n Well, let\\'s be clear when it comes to experience. What President Obama wants to do is he\\'s run to the United Nations, and he wants to use the United Nations to bind the United States, and take away our sovereignty. Well, I spent five and a half years as a Solicitor General of Texas, the lead lawyer for the state, in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, and I went in front of the Supreme Court, and took on the world court of the United Nations in a case called Medellin v. Texas, and we won a historic victory saying the World Court, and the U.N., has no power to bind the United States, and no President of the United States, Republican or Democrat, has the authority to give away our sovereignty.\\n\\nAnd, so, if there\\'s anyone up here who would be bound by this catastrophic deal with Iran, they\\'re giving up the core responsibility of commander in chief, and as president, I would never do that.\\n\\n Jake, Jake...\\n\\n Jake, there is no more important topic in 2016 than this topic right here, and I\\'ve listened to several folks saying, \"Well, gosh, if they cheat, we\\'ll act.\"\\n\\nWe won\\'t know under this agreement \\u2014 there are several facilities in Iran they designate as military facilities that are off limit all together. Beyond that, the other facilities, we give them 24 days notice before inspecting them. That is designed to allow them to hide the evidence.\\n\\nAnd most astonishingly, this agreement trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves. That makes no sense whatsoever.\\n\\nAnd let me know \\u2014 President Obama is violating federal law...\\n\\n ... by not handing over the side deals, and we ought to see the United States Congress...\\n\\n ... stand up together and say, \"Hand over this treaty, and protect this country.\"\\n\\n Well, let me tell you, Dana, number one, I\\'m proud to stand for life. These Planned Parenthood videos are horrifying. I would encourage every American to watch the videos. See \\u2014 seeing your Planned Parenthood officials callously, heartlessly bartering and selling the body parts of human beings, and then ask yourself, \"are these my values?\"\\n\\nThese are horrifying. On these videos, Planned Parenthood also essentially confesses to multiple felonies. It is a felony with ten years\\' jail term to sell the body parts of unborn children for profit. That\\'s what these videos show Planned Parenthood doing.\\n\\nAbsolutely we shouldn\\'t be sending $500 million of taxpayer money to funding an ongoing criminal enterprise, and I\\'ll tell you, the fact that Republican leadership in both houses has begun this discussion by preemptively surrendering to Barack Obama and saying, \"we\\'ll give in because Obama threatens a veto.\"\\n\\nYou know, Obama\\'s committed to his principles. His liberal principles, he will fight for them. He says...\\n\\n I will veto any budget that doesn\\'t fund Planned Parenthood, and Republicans surrender. We need to stop surrendering and start standing...\\n\\n ...for our principles. [applause]\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n Well, Jake, you know, I\\'m \\u2014 I\\'m very glad that Donald Trump\\'s being in this race has forced the mainstream media finally to talk about illegal immigration. I think that\\'s very important.\\n\\nI like and respect Ben Carson. I\\'ll let him talk about his own plans.\\n\\nBut I will say this: The natural next question that primary voters are asking, after we focus on illegal immigration is, okay, what are the records of the various candidates? And this is an issue on which there are stark differences.\\n\\nA majority of the men and women on this stage have previously and publicly embraced amnesty. I am the only candidate on this stage who has never supported amnesty and, in fact, who helped lead the fight to stop a massive amnesty plan.\\n\\nIn 2013, when Barack Obama and Harry Reid joined the Washington Republicans in a massive, I stood shoulder to shoulder with Jeff Sessions helping lead the fight.\\n\\nYou know, folks here have talked about, how do you secure the borders? Well, I\\'ve been leading the fight in the Senate to triple the Border Patrol, to put in place fencings and walls, to put in place a strong biometric exit/entry system...\\n\\n Well, Dana, I\\'ve known John Roberts for 20 years, he\\'s amazingly talented lawyer, but, yes, it was a mistake when he was appointed to the Supreme Court. He\\'s a good enough lawyer that he knows in these Obamacare cases he changed the statute, he changed the law in order to force that failed law on millions of Americans for a political outcome.\\n\\nAnd, you know, we\\'re frustrated as conservatives. We keep winning elections, and then we don\\'t get the outcome we want. And, let me focus on two moments in time.\\n\\nNumber one, in 1990, in one room was David Souter, and in another room was Edith Jones, the rock ribbed (ph) conservative on the fifth circuit court of appeals. George Herbert Walker Bush appointed David Souter.\\n\\nAnd then in 2005, in one room was John Roberts, in another room was my former boss, Mike Luttig, the rock ribbed (ph) conservative on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals...\\n\\n ...George W. Bush appointed John Roberts, and let me give you the consequences of that.\\n\\nIf, instead, the President Bush had appointed Edith Jones, and Mike Luttig, which is who I would have appointed, Obamacare would have been struck down three years ago, and the marriage laws of all 50 states would be on the books. These matter, and I fought to defend the constitution my whole life...\\n\\n ...and I will as president as well.\\n\\n It is true that after George W. Bush nominated John Roberts, I supported his confirmation. That was a mistake and I regret that. I wouldn\\'t have nominated John Roberts, and indeed, Governor Bush pointed out why.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t that the President Bushes wanted to appoint a liberal to the court, it\\'s that it was the easier choice. Both David Souter and John Roberts, they didn\\'t have a long paper trail. If you had nominated Edith Jones or Mike Ludig (ph) you would have had a bloody fight and they weren\\'t willing to spend political capital to put a strong judicial conservative on the court.\\n\\nI have spent my entire life, starting from clerking for Chief Justice William Rehnquist on the United States Supreme Court, one of the most principled jurists. We have an out-of-control Court, and I give you my word, if I\\'m elected president, every single Supreme Court justice will faithfully follow the law and will not act like philosopher kings \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 imposing their liberal policies on millions of Americans \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 who need to be trusted to govern ourselves.\\n\\n I \\u2014 I am not, and \\u2014 and you mentioned that the U.S. Supreme Court had rightly upheld the individual right to keep and bear arms.\\n\\nI was proud to lead 31 states before the U.S. Supreme Court defending the Second Amendment, and we won that landmark victory. And indeed, just a couple of years ago, when Harry Reid and Barack Obama came after the right to keep and bear arms of millions of Americans, I was proud to lead the fight in the United States Senate to protect our right to keep and bear arms, and for that reason...\\n\\n ... I was honored to be endorsed by Gun Owners of America...\\n\\n ... as the strongest supporter of the Second Amendment on this stage today, and I will...\\n\\n ... fight every day to defend the Bill of Rights.\\n\\n Well, I wouldn\\'t change the $10 bill, I\\'d change the $20. I\\'d take Jackson off and I\\'d leave Alexander Hamilton right where he is as one of our Founding Fathers. [applause]\\n\\nAnd I very much agree with Marco that it should be Rosa Parks. She was a principled pioneer that helped change this country, helped remedy racial injustice, and that would be an honor that would be entirely appropriate.\\n\\n You know, as a Cuban, I might go with Cohiba (ph), and I\\'ll tell you, I\\'d go with, for Heidi, Angel, because she is my angel.\\n\\n Ronald Reagan believed in America.\\n\\nIf I\\'m elected president our friends and allies across the globe will know that we stand with them. the bust of Winston Churchill will be back in the Oval Office, and the American embassy in Israel will be in Jerusalem.\\n\\nEnemies across this world will know the United States is not to be trifled with. ISIS will be defeated. We will have a president willing to utter the words, \"radical Islamic terrorism,\" and the Ayatollah Khamenei will understand that he will never, ever, ever acquire nuclear weapons.\\n\\nHere at home, we\\'ll reignite the promise of America. Young people coming out of school, with student loans up to their eyeballs, will find instead of no jobs, two, three, four, five job opportunities.\\n\\nHow will that happen? Through tax reform. We\\'ll pass a simple flat tax and abolish the IRS. And through regulatory reform, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.\\n\\nYou want to know what I\\'ll do as president? It is real simple. We\\'ll kill the terrorists, we\\'ll repeal Obamacare, and we will defend the Constitution, every single word of it. [applause]\\n\\n', ...],\n",

My story, from secretary to CEO, is only possible in this nation, and proves that everyone of us has potential. My husband, Frank, of 30 years, started out driving a tow truck for a family owned auto body shop. We have come to a pivotal point in our nation\\'s history where this nation\\'s possibilities and potential are being crushed by a government grown so big, so powerful, so inept, so corrupt, and a political class that refuses to do anything about it.\\n\\nI am prepared to lead the resurgence of this great nation. [applause]\\n\\n You know, I think Mr. Trump is a wonderful entertainer. He\\'s been terrific at that business.\\n\\nI also think that one of the benefits of a presidential campaign is the character and capability, judgment and temperament of every single one of us is revealed over time and under pressure. All of us will be revealed over time and under pressure. I look forward to a long race.\\n\\n That\\'s not for me to answer; it is for the voters of this country to answer, and I have a lot of faith in the common sense and good judgment of the voters of the United States of America.\\n\\n Jake, I\\'ll tell you \\u2014 I\\'ll tell you why people are supporting outsiders. It\\'s because you know what happens if someone\\'s been in the system their whole life, they don\\'t know how broken the system is. A fish swims in water, it doesn\\'t know it\\'s water. It\\'s not that politicians are bad people, it\\'s that they\\'ve been in that system forever.\\n\\nThe truth is 75 percent of the American people think the government is corrupt; 82 percent of the American people think these problems that have festered for 50 years in some cases, 25 years in other cases. The border\\'s been insecure for 25 years; 307,000 veterans have died waiting for health care. These things have gone on for so long because no one will challenge the status quo.\\n\\nYou know what a leader does? They challenge the status quo, they solve problems that have festered for a long time and they produce results. That is what my whole life has been about. People know this is about far more than replacing a D with an R \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 this is about changing the system.\\n\\n Having...\\n\\n Having met Vladimir Putin, if I may...\\n\\n Having met Vladimir Putin, I wouldn\\'t talk to him at all. We\\'ve talked way too much to him.\\n\\nWhat I would do, immediately, is begin rebuilding the Sixth Fleet, I would begin rebuilding the missile defense program in Poland, I would conduct regular, aggressive military exercises in the Baltic states. I\\'d probably send a few thousand more troops into Germany. Vladimir Putin would get the message. By the way, the reason it is so critically important that every one of us know General Suleimani\\'s name is because Russia is in Syria right now, because the head of the Quds force traveled to Russia and talked Vladimir Putin into aligning themselves with Iran and Syria to prop up Bashar al- Assad.\\n\\nRussia is a bad actor, but Vladimir Putin is someone we should not talk to, because the only way he will stop is to sense strength and resolve on the other side, and we have all of that within our control.\\n\\nWe could rebuild the Sixth Fleet. I will. We haven\\'t. We could rebuild the missile defense program. We haven\\'t. I will. We could also, to Senator Rubio\\'s point, give the Egyptians what they\\'ve asked for, which is intelligence.\\n\\nWe could give the Jordanians what they\\'ve asked for...\\n\\n ...bombs and materiel. We have not supplied it...\\n\\n ...I will. We could arm the Kurds. They\\'ve been asking us for three years. All of this is within our control. [applause]\\n\\n ...Jake...\\n\\n ...Jake, [inaudible]... [applause]\\n\\n And then it\\'ll be my turn.\\n\\n Jake?\\n\\n Jake?\\n\\n Dana, I\\'d like to...\\n\\n Dana, I would like to link these two issues, both of which are incredibly important, Iran and Planned Parenthood.\\n\\nOne has something to do with the defense of the security of this nation. The other has something to do with the defense of the character of this nation. You have not heard a plan about Iran from any politician up here, here is my plan. On day one in the Oval Office, I will make two phone calls, the first to my good friend to Bibi Netanyahu to reassure him we will stand with the state of Israel.\\n\\nThe second, to the supreme leader, to tell him that unless and until he opens every military and every nuclear facility to real anytime, anywhere inspections by our people, not his, we, the United States of America, will make it as difficult as possible and move money around the global financial system.\\n\\nWe can do that, we don\\'t need anyone\\'s cooperation to do it. And every ally and every adversary we have in this world will know that the United States in America is back in the leadership business, which is how we must stand with our allies.\\n\\nAs regards Planned Parenthood, anyone who has watched this videotape, I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, it\\'s heart beating, it\\'s legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.\\n\\nThis is about the character of our nation, and if we will not stand up in and force President Obama to veto this bill, shame on us. [applause]\\n\\n You know, it\\'s interesting to me, Mr. Trump said that he heard Mr. Bush very clearly and what Mr. Bush said. I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said. [applause]\\n\\n Dana, with all being said to Mr. Trump...\\n\\n Immigration did not come up in 2016 because Mr. Trump brought it up. We talked about it in 2012, we talked about it in 2008. We talked about it in 2004.\\n\\n We have been talking about it for 25 years. This is why people are tired of politicians.\\n\\n First let me say, We have just spent a good bit of time discussing, as Republicans, how to solve this problem. I would ask your audience at home to ask a very basic question. Why have Democrats not solved this problem?\\n\\nPresident Obama campaigned in 2007 and 2008 on solving the immigration problem. He entered Washington with majorities in the House and the Senate. He could have chosen to do anything to solve this pro \\u2014 this problem. Instead, he chose to do nothing.\\n\\nWhy? because the Democrats don\\'t want this issue solved.\\n\\n They want it to be an issue that they can use. As to birthright citizenship...\\n\\n ...the truth is, you can\\'t just wave your hands and say \"the 14th Amendment is gonna go away.\" It will take an extremely arduous vote in Congress, followed by two-thirds of the states, and if that doesn\\'t work to amend the Constitution, then it is a long, arduous process in court.\\n\\nAnd meanwhile, what will continue to go on is what has gone on for 25 years. With all due respect, Mr. Trump, we\\'ve been talking about illegal immigration for 25 years. San Francisco has been a sanctuary city since 1989. There are 300 of them.\\n\\nAnd meanwhile, what has happened? Nothing. The border remains insecure. The legal immigration system remains broken. Look, we know what it takes to secure a border. We\\'ve heard a lot of great ideas here. Money, manpower, technology...\\n\\n ...mostly, apparently, leadership...\\n\\n ...the kind of leadership that understands how to get results.\\n\\n But you \\u2014 you would stipulate, Mr. Trump, but not everyone agrees with you.\\n\\n OK.\\n\\n I led Hewlett Packard through a very difficult time, the worst technology recession in 25 years. The NASDAQ stock index fell 80 percent. It took 15 years for the stock index to recover. We had very strong competitors who literally went out of business and lost all of their jobs in the process.\\n\\nDespite those difficult times, we doubled the size of the company, we quadrupled its topline growth rate, we quadrupled its cash flow, we tripled its rate of innovation.\\n\\nYes, we had to make tough choices, and in doing so, we saved 80,000 jobs, went on to grow to 160,000 jobs. And now Hewlett Packard is almost 300,000 jobs. We went from lagging behind to leading in every product category and every market segment.\\n\\nWe must lead in this nation again, and some tough calls are going to be required. But as for the firing, I have been very honest about this from the day it happened. When you challenge the status quo, you make enemies. I made a few. Steve Jobs told me that when he called me the day I was fired to say, hey, been there, done that twice.\\n\\nIt\\'s also true that the man that led my firing, Tom Perkins, just took \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 out a full-page ad in the New York Times to say he was wrong, I was right. I was a terrific CEO, the board was dysfunctional. And he thinks I will make a magnificent president of the United States. [applause]\\n\\n You know, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is a well-known Clintonite and honestly had it out for me from the moment that I arrived at Hewlett Packard. But honestly, Mr. Trump, I find it quite rich that you would talk about this.\\n\\nYou know, there are a lot of us Americans who believe that we are going to have trouble someday paying back the interest on our debt because politicians have run up mountains of debt using other people\\'s money. That is in fact precisely the way you ran your casinos. You ran up mountains of debt, as well as losses, using other people\\'s money, and you were forced to file for bankruptcy not once \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 not twice, four times, a record four times. Why should we trust you to manage the finances \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 of this nation any differently than you managed the finances \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 of your casinos?\\n\\n Well \\u2014\\n\\n Well, Mr. Trump \\u2014\\n\\n A track record of leadership is not a game. It is the issue in this election.\\n\\n Well, I thought we had been hearing quite a bit about Govenor Christie\\'s record as governor, actually. I think track records are very important. I completely agree that what\\'s at stake here is the future of this nation, and the future of every American.\\n\\nBut I do think that a track record of leadership is vital because in the end this election is about leadership. And let\\'s talk about what leadership is. It\\'s not about braggadocio, it is about challenging the status quo, solving problems, producing results.\\n\\nAnd the highest calling of leadership is to unlock potential in others.\\n\\n Problems have festered in Washington for too long. And the potential of this nation is being crushed.\\n\\n You see, Governor Christie, people spend time talking about their track records, and Mr. Trump and I have every right to do the same. And Mrs. Clinton has to defend her track record.\\n\\nHer track record of lying about Benghazi, of lying about her e- mails, about lying about her servers. She does not have a track record of accomplishment.\\n\\nLike Mrs. Clinton, I, too, have travels hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe. But unlike Mrs. Clinton, I know flying is an activity, not an accomplishment. Mrs. Clinton \\u2014 if you want to stump a Democrat, ask them to name a accomplishment of Mrs. Clinton\\'s.\\n\\n We just spent \\u2014 we just spent the last 10 minutes...\\n\\n ...Jake, since everyone has gotten to weigh in on this military issue, I\\'d like to be able to do the same.\\n\\nWe have spent probably 12 minutes talking about the past. Let\\'s talk about the future. We need the strongest military on the face of the planet, and everyone has to know it. And, specifically, what that means is we need about 50 Army brigades, we need about 36 Marine battalions, we need somewhere between 300, and 350 naval ships, we need to upgrade every leg of the nuclear triad...\\n\\n ...we need to reform the Department of Defense, we need as well...\\n\\n ...to invest in our military technology, and we need to care for our veterans so 307,000...\\n\\n ...aren\\'t dying waiting for health care. [applause]\\n\\n Jake, may I just say...\\n\\n Jake \\u2014 Jake...\\n\\n I very much hope I am the only person on this stage who can say this, but I know there are millions of Americans out there who will say the same thing.\\n\\nMy husband Frank and I buried a child to drug addiction. So, we must invest more in the treatment of drugs.\\n\\n I wouldn\\'t change the $10 bill, or the $20 bill. I think, honestly, it\\'s a gesture. I don\\'t think it helps to change our history. What I would think is that we ought to recognize that women are not a special interest group. Women are the majority of this nation. We are half the potential of this nation, and this nation will be better off when every woman has the opportunity to live the life she chooses. [applause]\\n\\n Secretariat.\\n\\n I think what this nation can be and must be is symbolized by Lady Liberty and Lady Justice. Lady Liberty stands tall and strong. She is clear-eyed and resolute. She doesn\\'t shield her eyes from the realities of the world, but she faces outward into the world nevertheless, as we always must.\\n\\nAnd she holds her torch high, because she knows she is a beacon of hope in a very troubled world.\\n\\nAnd Lady Justice, Lady Justice holds a sword by her side, because she is a fighter, a warrior for the values and the principles that have made this nation great. She holds a scale in her other hand. And with that scale she says all of us are equal in the eyes of God. And so all of us must be equal in the eyes of the law and the government, powerful and powerless alike.\\n\\nAnd she wears a blindfold. And with that blindfold she is saying to us that it must be true, it can be true that in this country, in this century, it doesn\\'t matter who you are, it doesn\\'t matter what you look like, it doesn\\'t matter how you start, it doesn\\'t matter your circumstances, here in this nation, every American\\'s life must be filled with the possibilities that come from their God-given gifts.\\n\\nOne nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

He did not, his knees buckled.\\n\\nWe now have 4 million refugees, Syria is a living hell, and he turned to the Congress for the authority to back him up. You have three senators to your right that said, no.

You refused to attack Hillary Clinton, you just don\\'t want to go there, you want to do the up with people. Go, Ohio, OK, and I like that.\\n\\nCarly Fiorina, I don\\'t have to bring up the Secretary of State \\u2014 you bring her up, so [inaudible].\\n\\nWhich one of you is wrong?

I\\'ve done a lot of great interviews with all of you, but, Governor Bush, I talked to you in February about the biggest elephant in a room full of elephants, which is your last name. And you said you would not be burdened either by your brother or your father\\'s legacy in the Middle East.\\n\\nAnd then, a week later, you rolled out your list of foreign policy advisers, and it was a lot of the band getting back together again. So on behalf of the military that is watching...\\n\\n ...OK, the active duty military that are at the end of the sphere (ph), what kind of a commander in chief is Jeb Bush going to be, and who are the advisers that are new to your team?\\n\\n Mr. \\u2014 Mr. Trump.\\n\\n I want to ask you a question, though, you promised us great leaders. And I believe that. But Jeb Bush has laid out 20 different people that have experience around the world. There are 190 countries, you can\\'t run the world by yourself.\\n\\nWhen are we going to get some names on your military and your foreign policy advisers?\\n\\n Thank you, Jake.\\n\\nTomorrow is \\u2014 Republicans know this \\u2014 tomorrow is Constitution Day. We\\'ve been talking about the 10th Amendment.

In this state, there\\'s a controversial law that allows guns to be taken away from people without a hearing.\\n\\nWhere does it go \\u2014 and the problem of violence is endemic, but where does it go from what you said last week, how far into people\\'s lives to take guns away from them?\\n\\n If a family member calls and says, \"My child, my brother, my sister is disturbed,\" ought the state be able to go and get their weapon without a hearing?\\n\\n Thank you, Senator.\\n\\n Senator Cruz, I want to go to you.\\n\\nYour constitutional litigant (ph), are you afraid of the next- step theory of what happens to Second Amendment rights?\\n\\n Thank you, Senator.\\n\\n Thank you, Senator.\\n\\n Thank you, senator.\\n\\n', ...],\n",
       " u'HUCKABEE': [u' Chris, I disagree with the idea that the real issue is a constitutional amendment. That\\'s a long and difficult process. I\\'ve actually taken the position that\\'s bolder than that.\\n\\nA lot of people are talking about defunding planned parenthood, as if that\\'s a huge game changer. I think it\\'s time to do something even more bold. I think the next president ought to invoke the Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the constitution now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mother\\'s womb is a person at the moment of conception.\\n\\nThe reason we know that it is is because of the DNA schedule that we now have clear scientific evidence on. And, this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn child\\'s Fifth and 14th Amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law.\\n\\nIt\\'s time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being, and we change the policy to be pro-life and protect children instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like they\\'re parts to a Buick. [applause]\\n\\n Not me. [laughter] But you\\'re welcome to give me a check, Donald if you\\'d like.\\n\\n It\\'s not too big to shrink. But the problem is we have a Wall Street-to-Washington axis of power that has controlled the political climate. The donor class feeds the political class who does the dance that the donor class wants. And the result is federal government keeps getting bigger.\\n\\nEvery person on this stage who has been a governor will tell that you the biggest fight they had was not the other party. Wasn\\'t even the legislature. It was the federal government, who continually put mandates on the states that we had to suck up and pay for.\\n\\nAnd the fact is there are a lot of things happening at the federal level that are absolutely beyond the jurisdiction of the Constitution. This is power that should be shifted back to the states, whether it\\'s the EPA, there is no role at the federal level for the Department of Education. [cheering and applause]\\n\\nAnd I\\'m still one who says that we can get rid of the Internal Revenue Service if we would pass the FairTax, which is a tax on consumption rather than a tax on people\\'s income, and move power back where the founders believed it should have been all along.\\n\\n Well, let\\'s all be reminded, 60 million Americans are on Social Security, 60 million. A third of those people depend on 90% of their income from Social Security. Nobody in this country is on Social Security because they made the decision when they were starting work at 14 that they wanted to trust some of their money with the government.\\n\\nThe government took it out of their check whether they wanted them to or not. And, if person goes to 65, they\\'re going to spend 51 years with the government reaching into their pocket at every paycheck.\\n\\nNow, here\\'s the point, whose fault is it that the system is screwed up? Is it the recipients, or is it the government? And, if Congress wants to mess with the retirement program, why don\\'t we let them start by changing their retirement program, and not have one, instead of talking about getting rid of Social Security and Medicare that was robbed $700 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare.\\n\\nIt\\'s always that the government figures that they can do this off the backs of people, many of whom are poor, and depend on that money, and I just think it\\'s fundamentally lying to the people and stealing from them, and we shouldn\\'t be doing it. [applause]\\n\\n Well, you ask about how we fund it. One of the reasons that Social Security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage. The people who get wages is declining dramatically. Most of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and -- and capital gains.\\n\\nThe FairTax transforms the process by which we fund Social Security and Medicare because the money paid in consumption is paid by everybody, including illegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, all the people [timer sounds] that are freeloading off the system now. [applause]\\n\\nThat\\'s why it ought to be a transformed system. [applause]\\n\\n Ronald Reagan said \"trust, but verify.\" President Obama is \"trust, but vilify.\" He trusts our enemies and vilifies everyone who disagrees with him.\\n\\nAnd the reason we disagree with him has nothing to do with party. [applause]\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n The military is not a social experiment. The purpose of the military is kill people and break things. [applause]\\n\\nIt\\'s not to transform the culture by trying out some ideas that some people think would make us a different country and more diverse. The purpose is to protect America. I\\'m not sure how paying for transgender surgery for soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines makes our country safer.\\n\\nWe\\'ve reduced the military by 25 percent... [applause] ... under President Obama. The disaster is that we\\'ve forgotten why we have a military. The purpose of it is to make sure that we protect every American, wherever that American is, and if an American is calling out for help, whether it\\'s in Benghazi or at the border, then we ought to be able to answer it.\\n\\nWe\\'ve not done that because we\\'ve decimated our military. We\\'re flying B-52s. The most recent one that was put in service was November of 1962. A lot of the B-52s we\\'re flying, we\\'ve only got 44 that are in service combat ready, and the fact is, most of them are older than me. And that\\'s pretty scary.\\n\\n[laughter and applause]\\n\\n It seems like this election has been a whole lot about a person who\\'s very high in the polls, that doesn\\'t have a clue about how to govern.\\n\\nA person who has been filled with scandals, and who could not lead, and, of course, I\\'m talking about Hillary Clinton. [laughter]\\n\\nI think America...\\n\\n ...is in trouble, but it\\'s not beyond repair. But it\\'s going to take leadership who sees the greatness of this country, and who believes that once again we can be one nation, under God.\\n\\nI\\'ll be my best to do that, and thank you for your support. [applause]\\n\\n', u' I\\'m Mike Huckabee. I\\'m delighted to be on this stage with some remarkable fellow Republicans.\\n\\nNone of us are a self-professed socialist. None of us on this state are under investigation by the FBI because we destroyed government records, or because we leaked secrets.\\n\\nI know that there are some in the Wall-Street-to-Washington axis of power who speak of all of us contemptuously. But I\\'m here to say that I think we are, in fact, the A team.\\n\\nWe have some remarkable people, and, in fact, not only are we the A team; we even have our own Mr. T, who doesn\\'t mind saying about others, \"you\\'re a fool.\"\\n\\nAnd I\\'m delighted to be here with all of these guys, and would put any of them in an administration that I led. Thank you very much. [applause]\\n\\n I would certainly love to get in on this, because I think the single...\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n I\\'ve been patiently waiting, and I\\'m going to just say this about Iran.\\n\\n Because I think it is incredibly important. This is really about the survival of Western civilization. This is not just a little conflict with a Middle Eastern country that we\\'ve just now given over $100 billion to, the equivalent in U.S. terms is $5 trillion.\\n\\nThis threatens Israel immediately, this threatens the entire Middle East, but it threatens the United States of America. And we can\\'t treat a nuclear Iranian government as if it is just some government that would like to have power. This is a government for 36 years has killed Americans, they kidnapped Americans, they have maimed Americans. They have sponsored terrorist groups, Hamas and Hezbollah, and they threaten the very essence of Western civilization.\\n\\nTo give them this agreement, that the president treats like the Magna Carta, but Iranians treat it like it\\'s toilet paper, and we must, simply, make it very clear that the next president, one of us on this stage, will absolutely not honor that agreement, and will destroy it and will be tough with Iran, because otherwise, we put every person in this world in a very dangerous place. [applause]\\n\\n No, I don\\'t think he\\'s on the wrong side of such an issue. Jeb is a friend. I\\'m not up here to fight with Jeb or to fight with anybody else.\\n\\nBut I am here to fight for somebody who is a county clerk elected under the Kentucky constitution that 75 percent of the people of that state had voted for that said that marriage was between a man and a woman.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court in a very, very divided decision decided out of thin air that they were just going to redefine marriage. It\\'s a decision that the other justices in dissent said they didn\\'t have and there wasn\\'t a constitutional shred of capacity for them to do it.\\n\\nI thought that everybody here passed ninth-grade civics. The courts cannot legislate. That\\'s what Roberts said. But heck, it\\'s what we learned in civics.\\n\\nThe courts can\\'t make a law. They can interpret one. They can review one. They can\\'t implement it. They can\\'t force it.\\n\\nBut here\\'s what happened: Because the courts just decided that something was going to be and people relinquished it and the other two branches of government sat by silently \\u2014 I thought we had three branches of government, they were all equal to each other, we have separation of powers, and we have checks and balances.\\n\\nIf the court can just make a decision and we just all surrender to it, we have what Jefferson said was judicial tyranny.\\n\\nThe reason that this is a real issue that we need to think about...\\n\\n No, no. Let me finish this one thought, Jake. I haven\\'t gotten that much time, so I\\'m going to take just what little I can here.\\n\\nWe made accommodation to the Fort Hood shooter to let him grow a beard. We made accommodations to the detainees at Gitmo \\u2014 I\\'ve been to Gitmo, and I\\'ve seen the accommodations that we made to the Muslim detainees who killed Americans.\\n\\nYou\\'re telling me that you cannot make an accommodation for an elected Democrat county clerk from Rowan County, Kentucky? What else is it other than the criminalization of her faith and the exaltation of the faith of everyone else who might be a Fort Hood shooter or a detainee at Gitmo? [applause]\\n\\n I have a different idea. I think we ought to get rid of all the taxes on people who produce. Why should we penalize productivity? And it\\'s why I\\'m an unabashed supporter of the \"fair tax,\" which would be a tax on our consumption, rather than a tax on our productivity.\\n\\nIn other words, you\\'re not going to tax anybody for what they earn, whether it\\'s worker whose working by the hour or whether it\\'s a hedge fund manager. If they can produce something and bring capital and labor to create jobs, we need some jobs. And I think the \"fair tax\" makes more sense.\\n\\nNow, Jake, I\\'ve been listening to everybody on the stage and there is a lot of back and forth about I\\'m the only one who has done this, the only one who has done that, I\\'ve done great things.\\n\\nWe\\'ve all done great things or we wouldn\\'t be on this stage. But it occurs to me as we\\'re sitting here in the Reagan Library that most of us would like to pay tribute to a guy who, when he got elected, didn\\'t get elected telling everybody how great he was.\\n\\nHe got elected telling everybody how great the American people were. And he empowered them to live their dreams, which is what I\\'d love to see us do by no longer penalizing the people who are out there working because they are taking a gut punch right now. [applause]\\n\\n ...You don\\'t want me operating on you, I assure you. [laughter]\\n\\n Just today \\u2014 just today, there was a new report that 50 different intelligence analysts have said that what they sent up the ladder was doctored by senior officials, so that they could give some happy talk to the situation that we face.\\n\\nI love the idea of a good intellectual capacity to deal with our enemies, but the fact is, if you don\\'t have good intelligence that is reliable and honest, you won\\'t have good intelligence and you cannot make good decisions.\\n\\nThe next president is primarily elected not just to know things, but to know what to do with the things that he knows. And the most dangerous person in any room is the person who doesn\\'t know what he doesn\\'t know.\\n\\n And the reason Barack Obama has been dangerous to this country and we better elect someone who had some executive experience, is because we cannot afford another eight years having a person in the office who doesn\\'t know what he does not know.\\n\\n You better believe I will, because I\\'m tired of liberals always having a litmus test and conservatives are supposed to pretend we don\\'t. Well let me tell you what mine would be.\\n\\nNumber one, I\\'d ask do you think that the unborn child is a human being or is it just a blob of tissue? I\\'d want to know the answer to that. I\\'d want to know do you believe in the First Amendment, do you believe that religious liberty is the fundamental liberty around which all the other freedoms of this country are based? And I\\'d want to know do you really believe in the Second Amendment, do you believe that we have an individual right to bear arms to protect ourselves and our family and to protect our country? And do you believe in the Fifth and the 14th Amendment? Do you believe that a person, before they\\'re deprived of life and liberty, should in fact have due process and equal protection under the law? Because if you do, you\\'re going to do more than defund Planned Parenthood.\\n\\n One final thing. I\\'d make darn sure that we absolutely believe the 10th Amendment. Every governor on this stage would share this much with you. Every one of us \\u2014 our biggest fight wasn\\'t always with the legislature or even with the Democrats. My gosh, half the time, it was with the federal government who apparently never understood \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 that if it\\'s not reserved in the Constitution, then the 10th Amendment says it\\'s left to the states. But somebody forgot to send a memo to Washington.\\n\\n Jake? Jake?\\n\\n I think we need to remember that there are maybe some controversies about autism, but there is no controversy about the things that are really driving the medical costs in this country.\\n\\nAnd I would really believe that the next president ought to declare a war on cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer\\'s, because those are the four things that are causing the greatest level of cost.\\n\\nJohn Kennedy said, \"we\\'ll go to the moon in a decade and bring a man back,\" and we did it. I grew up in the \\'50s. I remember the polio vaccine. We saved billions of dollars since that time, because we haven\\'t had to treat for polio.\\n\\nWhy doesn\\'t this country focus on cures rather than treatment? Why don\\'t we put a definitive focus scientifically on finding the cure for cancer, for heart disease, for diabetes and for Alzheimer\\'s, a disease alone that will cost us \\u2014\\n\\n $1.1 trillion by the year 2050. We change the economy and the country.\\n\\n That\\'s an easy one. I\\'d put my wife on there. [laughter]\\n\\nI\\'ve been married to her 41 years. She\\'s fought cancer and lived through it. She\\'s raised three kids, five great grandkids, and she\\'s put up with me. I mean, who else could possibly be on that money other than my wife. And that way, she could spend her own money with her face. [laughter]\\n\\n I\\'d go with Duck Hunter.\\n\\n At the end of my presidency I would like to believe that the world would be a safe place, and there wouldn\\'t be the threats. not only to the U.S., but to Israel and our allies, because we would have the most incredible well-trained, well-equipped, well- prepared military in the history of mankind. And they would know that the commander-in-chief would never send them to a mission without all the resources necessary, but people wouldn\\'t bully us anymore. Because they would know that that would be an invitation to their destruction.\\n\\nDomestically, we would be operating under a tax system that eliminated the IRS. People wouldn\\'t be punished for their work, and for what they produced.\\n\\nAnd life would be really deemed precious. Abortion would be no more. It would be as much of a scourge in our past as slavery is. And we would have a peaceful country, where people respected each other and people respected law enforcement. And we would focus on cures.\\n\\nAnd we would make this country not only safe from our enemies without, but safe from the enemies within. And it would be a good place to raise our kids and our grandkids. [applause]\\n\\n', ...],\n",
       " u'KASICH': [u' Well, first of all... [applause] ...first of all, Megyn, you should know that -- that President Reagan expanded Medicaid three or four times.\\n\\nSecondly, I had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio to do what?\\n\\nTo treat the mentally ill. Ten thousand of them sit in our prisons. It costs $22,500 a year... [applause] ...to keep them in prison. I\\'d rather get them their medication so they could lead a decent life.\\n\\nSecondly, we are rehabbing the drug-addicted. Eighty percent of the people in our prisons have addictions or problems. We now treat them in the prisons, release them in the community and the recidivism rate is 10 percent and everybody across this country knows that the tsunami of drugs is -- is threatening their very families.\\n\\nSo we\\'re treating them and getting them on their feet. And, finally, the working poor, instead of them having come into the emergency rooms where it costs more, where they\\'re sicker and we end up paying, we brought a program in here to make sure that people could get on their feet.\\n\\nAnd do you know what?\\n\\nEverybody has a right to their God-given purpose.\\n\\nAnd finally, our Medicaid is growing at one of the lowest rates in the country. And, finally, we went from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black. We\\'ve cut $5 billion in taxes... [timer sounds] ...and we\\'ve grown 350,000 jobs. [applause]\\n\\n Chris, first of all, I was just saying to Chris Christie, they say we\\'re outspoken, we need to take lessons from Donald Trump if we\\'re really going to learn it. Here is the thing about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is hitting a nerve in this country. He is. He\\'s hitting a nerve. People are frustrated. They\\'re fed up. They don\\'t think the government is working for them. And for people who want to just tune him out, they\\'re making a mistake.\\n\\nNow, he\\'s got his solutions. Some of us have other solutions. You know, look, I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington. Hasn\\'t been done since. I was a military reformer. I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole and a 350,000 job loss to a $2 billion surplus and a gain of 350,000 jobs.\\n\\n But the point is that we all have solutions. Mr. Trump is touching a nerve because people want the wall to be built. They want to see an end to illegal immigration. They want to see it, and we all do. But we all have different ways of getting there. And you\\'re going to hear from all of us tonight about what our ideas are.\\n\\n Donald, if you...[crosstalk]\\n\\n -- this campaign, I hope you will give to me.\\n\\n OK.\\n\\n Let\\'s start off with my father being a mailman. So I understand the concerns of all the folks across this country, some of whom have trouble, you know, making ends meet. But I think she will come in a narrow way. The nominee of this party, if they\\'re going to win, has got to come at it in a big way, which is pro-growth. Which is balancing budgets. You know, we were talking about it. People were saying, could we do it? I was the chairman of the Budget Committee and the lead architect the last time it happened in Washington, and when we did it we had great economic growth, we cut taxes, and we had a big surplus.\\n\\nEconomic growth is the key. Economic growth is the key to everything. But once you have economic growth, it is important that we reach out to people who live in the shadows, the people who don\\'t seem to ever think that they get a fair deal. And that includes people in our minority community; that includes people who feel as though they don\\'t have a chance to move up.\\n\\nYou know, America is a miracle country. And we have to restore the sense that the \"Amiracle\" will apply to you. Each and every one of the people in this country who\\'s watching tonight, lift everybody, [timer sounds] unite everybody and build a stronger United States of America again. It will be and can be done.\\n\\n Well, look, I\\'m an old-fashioned person here, and I happen to believe in traditional marriage. But I\\'ve also said the court has ruled --\\n\\n Wait, Megyn, the court has ruled, and I said we\\'ll accept it. And guess what, I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay. Because somebody doesn\\'t think the way I do, doesn\\'t mean that I can\\'t care about them or can\\'t love them. So if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them. Because you know what? [applause]\\n\\nThat\\'s what we\\'re taught when we have strong faith. [applause]\\n\\nSo the issues like that, issues like that are planted to divide us. I think the simple fact of the matter is, and this is where I would agree with Jeb, and I\\'ve been saying it all along, we need to give everybody a chance, treat everybody with respect, and let them share in this great American dream that we have, Megan. So, look, I\\'m going to love my daughters, I\\'m going to love them no matter what they do. Because, you know what, [timer sounds] God gives me unconditional love. I\\'m going to give it to my family and my friends and the people around me.\\n\\n Well, Megyn, my father was a mailman. His father was a coal miner. My mother\\'s mother could barely speak English. And their son today stands on this podium in the great state of Ohio not only as the governor, but a candidate for president of the United States. [cheering and applause]\\n\\nI do believe in miracles. You know, I\\'ve had a lot of elections. But my elections are really not about campaigns. I tell my people that these are about a movement. And a movement to do what? To restore common sense. A movement to do things like provide economic growth. And a movement not to let anybody be behind.\\n\\nYou know, today the country is divided. You asked a question about the police and the difficulty in communities. We\\'ve got to unite our country again, because we\\'re stronger when we are united and we are weaker when we are divided.\\n\\nAnd we\\'ve got to listen to other people\\'s voices, respect them, but keep in mind, and I believe in terms of the things that I\\'ve read in my lifetime, the Lord\\'is not picking us. But because of how we respect human rights, because that we are a good force in the world, he wants America to be strong.\\n\\nHe wants America to succeed. And he wants America to lead. And nothing is more important to me than my family, my faith, and my friends. [cheering and applause]\\n\\n You know, tonight we hear about what people want to do. I want to tell you what I\\'ve done. I was a member of the Armed Services Committee for 18 years. I spent a big chunk of my life studying national security issues and our role in the world.\\n\\nNo. 2. I was the chairman of the House Budget Committee and one of the chief architects the last time we balanced a budget, and it was the first time we had done it since man walked on the moon. We had a $5 trillion surplus and we cut taxes.\\n\\nI spent ten years in the private sector, actually learning how business works. And now I\\'m the governor of Ohio, and I inherited a state that was on the brink [timer sounds] of dying. And we turned it all around with jobs and balanced budgets and rising credit and tax cuts, and the state is unified, and people have hope again in Ohio. [applause]\\n\\n', u' Hello, I\\'m John Kasich, the Governor of Ohio. Emma, and Reese, my children, and Karen, love \\'ya girls. Thanks for watching tonight.\\n\\nBy the way, I think I actually flew on this plane with Ronald Reagan when I was a congressman, and his goals, and mine, really much \\u2014 are pretty much the same. Lift Americans, unify, give hope, grow America, and restore it is to that great, shining city on a hill.\\n\\nYes, he was a great one, and I learned much from watching him. The most important thing, hope to Americans, unify, lift everyone in America. [applause]\\n\\n Jake, Jake.\\n\\n Listen, you know, I \\u2014 if I were sitting at home and watch thing back and forth, I would be inclined to turn it off. I mean, people at home want to know across this country, they want to know what we\\'re going to do to fix this place, how we\\'ll balance a budget, how we\\'re going to create more economic growth, how we\\'ll pay down the debt. What we\\'re going to do to strengthen the military.\\n\\nSo, we just spent 10 minutes here...\\n\\n But \\u2014 but wait a minute. It\\'s a lot of ad hogshead. Now, I know that it may be buzzing out there, but I think it\\'s important we get to the issues, because that\\'s what people want, and they don\\'t want all this fighting.\\n\\n ...Yeah, well...\\n\\n Well, let me just say this. First of all, I think it\\'s a bad agreement, I would never have done it. But, you know, a lot of our problems in the world today is that we don\\'t have the relationship with our allies. If we want to go everywhere alone, we will not have the strength as (ph) if we could rebuild with our allies.\\n\\nNow, this agreement, we don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen in 18 months. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years. I\\'ve seen lots of issues in foreign affairs, and foreign \\u2014 in terms of global politics, you have to be steady.\\n\\nNow, here\\'s the \\u2014 if they cheat, we slap the sanctions back on. If they help Hamas, and Hezbollah, we slap the sanctions back on. And, if we find out that they may be developing a nuclear weapon, than the military option is on the table. We are stronger when we work with the Western civilization, our friends in Europe, and just doing it on our own I don\\'t think is the right policy.\\n\\n No, no, no. I want to \\u2014 I want to \\u2014 I want to say something about what the senator just said.\\n\\n No one is \\u2014 no \\u2014 let me \\u2014 let me suggest to you we believe that we operate better in the world when our allies work with us. President Bush did it in the Gulf War. We work better when we are unified.\\n\\nSecondly, nobody\\'s trusting Iran. They violate the deal, we put on the sanctions, and we have the high moral ground to talk to our allies in Europe to get them to go with us.\\n\\nIf they don\\'t go with us, we slap the sanctions on anyway. If they fund these radical groups that threaten Israel and all of the West, then we should rip up the deal and put the sanctions back on.\\n\\nAnd let me make it clear \\u2014 let me make it clear...\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n We can have it, and we can have our allies, and we can be strong as a country, and we can project across this globe with unity, not just doing it alone. That is not what gets us where we want to get as a nation.\\n\\n Well, I agree that we should defund Planned Parenthood. I don\\'t know many people in America who don\\'t think that we should, and in my state, we\\'re trying to figure out how to get it done, because we are threatened with the federal government taking all of our Medicaid money away.\\n\\nI think there is a way to get this done by giving governors the ability to be able to act to defund Planned Parenthood. But when (ph) it comes to closing down the federal government, you gotta be very careful about that.\\n\\nWhen we shut the government down \\u2014 if we have a chance at success and it\\'s a great principle, yes. The president of the United States is not going to sign this, and all we\\'re gonna do is shut the government down, and then we\\'re gonna open up \\u2014 open it up, and the American people are gonna shake their heads and say, \"what\\'s the story with these Republicans?\"\\n\\nSo I think there is a way to get to cutting off the funding for Planned Parenthood. I was in the Congress for 18 years, balanced the budget, cut taxes, got it done. Changed welfare, went around the president to get welfare reform done.\\n\\nThere are ways to do it without having to shut the government down, but I\\'m sympathetic to the fact that we don\\'t want this organization to get funding, and the money ought to be reprogrammed for family planning in other organizations that don\\'t support this tactic.\\n\\nBut I would not be for shutting the government down...\\n\\n ...because I don\\'t think it\\'s going to work out.\\n\\n We\\'re not \\u2014 what I can tell you is this. We didn\\'t surrender in New Jersey, six years ago, as the brand new first ever pro-life governor of New Jersey since Roe versus Wade, I defended Planned Parenthood.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ve vetoed Planned Parenthood funding, now, eight times in New Jersey. Since the day I walked in as governor, Planned Parenthood has not been funded in New Jersey. We stood up and every one of those vetoes has been sustained.\\n\\nBut here\\'s the problem, we\\'re \\u2014 we\\'re fighting with each other up here. We agree. Let\\'s ask Hillary Clinton. She believes in the systematic murder of children in the womb to preserve their body parts...\\n\\n ...Dana, in a way that maximizes their value for sale for profit. It is disgusting, and the American people need to hear it...\\n\\n ...we shouldn\\'t be fighting with each other. She\\'s the real opponent, she\\'s the real problem.\\n\\n I\\'ll tell you what \\u2014 I\\'ll tell you what I\\'d be willing to fight for. I\\'ll tell you what I\\'d be willing to fight for. Why will (ph) we put tax reform on the president\\'s desk, so we can simplify this tax system?\\n\\n No, no, it\\'s really important, Dana. We got to talk about what we would be willing to shut down for. Why don\\'t we put tax reform on this president\\'s desk, and make him veto it if that\\'s what he wants to do? Why haven\\'t we repealed and replaced Obamacare?\\n\\nMake him veto if that\\'s what he wants to do.\\n\\n There\\'s a \\u2014\\n\\n Jake \\u2014\\n\\n OK, Jake.\\n\\n I don\\'t at this point in terms of changing the incentives for investment and risk-taking.\\n\\nBut let\\'s just stop for a second. There\\'s one person on this stage that does have a record. I\\'m the only person on the stage and one of the few people in this country that led the effort as the chief architect of the last time we balanced the federal budget.\\n\\nWe also cut taxes. And when I left Washington in 2000, we had a $5 trillion surplus, and the economy was booming. I had spent 10 years of my life to get us to that point, went out in the private sector, was a great experience, and went into Ohio and took an $8 billion hole and turned it into a $2 billion surplus.\\n\\nWe\\'ve had the largest amount of tax cuts of any sitting governor. We\\'ve grown well over 300,000 jobs. You see, I\\'ve done it in both places. I\\'m the only one here that has done it in both places.\\n\\nIt took a lot to get us to a balanced budget. It was legitimate. It was real. And we negotiated it. A lot of what we\\'re talking about here tonight as we take this position and that position, you know what? At the end of the day, America has got to work.\\n\\nWe\\'ve got to figure out how we come together to deal with this \\u2014 with our fiscal problems because when we deal with that, we create a stronger economy for everybody. People have a chance to rise.\\n\\nSo, you know, when we think about how we make a choice, it\\'s the person that lands that plane. It\\'s not somebody that talks about it. It\\'s about the person who has done it. And I\\'ve done it in...\\n\\n ... both places. And I did it including people in the other party. And that\\'s how we were successful.\\n\\n And that\\'s how I will be president, using that experience to drive this country forward. Thank you. [applause]\\n\\n Well, look, people still have to get to know me, so I want to spend my time talking about my experience reforming welfare, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, providing economic growth when I was in Washington, turning Ohio around. Eight billion in the hole, $2 billion surplus, up over 300,000 jobs, big tax cuts, strengthening our credit.\\n\\nAll those things matter but, you know, as a young man in my first election in 1978, I defeated an incumbent Democrat. I defeated an incumbent Democrat in 1982; running on the Reagan program, I was the only Republican in America to defeat an incumbent Democrat that year.\\n\\nAnd then, when I won for election of governor, I was the first Republican to defeat an incumbent in 36 years, and the first person to have never run statewide out of politics for 10 years to beat an incumbent. That hadn\\'t happened for 96 years.\\n\\nSo, we\\'ll get to the point where we\\'ll talk about Hillary Clinton, or whoever the nominee is, record. But right now, I want to give people sense of hope, sense of purpose, a sense of unity, sense that we can do it. So...\\n\\n You know, at the end of the day, I\\'m going to continue to talk about my record, because there is, did you ever notice when people run for office, they run for president, they make a lot of promises, they don\\'t keep them.\\n\\n I don\\'t intend to do that, and I going to be out there pushing it out \\u2014 don\\'t worry about me and Hillary. That will all work out, and I\\'m from Ohio. She will not beat me there, I can promise you that. [applause]\\n\\n Can I just \\u2014 can I \\u2014 Jake, can I just make one point on this whole military discussion?\\n\\n I called for boots on the ground many months ago in a coalition with our friends who share our interest. You know, you win a battle with the military, and when we go somewhere, we need to be mobile, and lethal. We need to take care of business, and we need to come home.\\n\\nBut, we face, also, a bigger war \\u2014 and you win the bigger war with the battle of ideas. You wonder why young people, and educated people, rich people, schooled people, have tried to join ISIS.\\n\\nWestern civilization, all of us, need to wake up to the fact that those murderers and rapists need to be called out, and in Western civilization we need to make it clear that our faith in the Jewish and Christian principals force us to live a life bigger than ourselves...\\n\\n ...to make (ph) centers (ph) of justice so that we can battle the radicals, call them out for what they are, and make sure that all of our people feel fulfilled in living in Western civilization...\\n\\n ...This is a giant battle in the world today...\\n\\n Well, it\\'s probably not, maybe, legal, but, I would pick Mother Theresa, the lady that I had a chance to meet, a woman who lived a life so much bigger than her own. An inspiration to everyone when we think about our responsibility to love our neighbor as we love ourselves.\\n\\n Well, I have one now \\u2014 they (ph) call me, \"Unit One\".\\n\\nMy wife says, \"You\\'ll never be Unite One, I\\'m Unite One. You\\'re Unit Two.\"\\n\\n Well, as president, I will make this a nation that will solve problems. And how? By having the elected officials and the leaders realize they\\'re Americans before they\\'re Republicans or Democrats. I did it in Washington. And I\\'ve done it in Ohio by having the elected officials realize that they\\'re Ohioans before anything else.\\n\\nSecondly, I will rebuild the relationships and show the respect to our allies around the world. We have no choice but to do that. We will be stronger when we are unified. And we\\'ll fight for freedom and for human rights.\\n\\nAnd finally, a little bit of what Carly said. The people that are out there listening, America was never great because we ran America from the top down. America is great because we have run America from the bottom up, where we all live in the neighborhoods.\\n\\nOne more time in America, we need to revive the concept of citizenship, where everybody\\'s actions make a huge difference in changing the world. We have a Holocaust memorial on our state house grounds. And there is one line on there that stands out all the time. \"If you\\'ve saved one life, you\\'ve changed the world.\"\\n\\nWe need to adopt that as citizens and rebuild and reinspire our country. Thank you. [applause]\\n\\n', ...],\n",
       " u'KELLY': [u' Welcome to the first debate night of the 2016 presidential campaign, live from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.\\n\\nI\\'m Megyn Kelly... [applause]... along with my co-moderators, Brett Baier and Chris Wallace.\\n\\nTonight... [applause] Nice.\\n\\nTonight, thousands of people here in the Q, along with millions of voters at home will get their very first chance to see the candidates face off in a debate, answering the questions you want answered.\\n\\n As for the candidates who will be answering those questions? Here they are.\\n\\nPositioned on the stage by how they stand in the polls, in the center of the stage tonight, businessman Donald Trump. [applause]\\n\\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush. [applause]\\n\\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker. [applause]\\n\\nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. [applause]\\n\\n Gentlemen, our first round of questions is on the subject of electability in the general election, and we start tonight with you, Dr. Carson.\\n\\nYou are a successful neurosurgeon, but you admit that you have had to study up on foreign policy, saying there\\'s a lot to learn.\\n\\nYour critics say that your inexperience shows. You\\'ve suggested that the Baltic States are not a part of NATO, just months ago you were unfamiliar with the major political parties and government in Israel, and domestically, you thought Alan Greenspan had been treasury secretary instead of federal reserve chair.\\n\\nAren\\'t these basic mistakes, and don\\'t they raise legitimate questions about whether you are ready to be president?\\n\\n Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don\\'t use a politician\\'s filter. However, that is not without its downsides, in particular, when it comes to women.\\n\\nYou\\'ve called women you don\\'t like \"fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.\" [laughter] Your Twitter account...\\n\\n No, it wasn\\'t. [applause] Your Twitter account... [applause]\\n\\n For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O\\'Donnell.\\n\\n Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women\\'s looks. You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president, and how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who was likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women?\\n\\n Governor Walker, you\\'ve consistently said that you want to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. You recently signed an abortion law in Wisconsin that does have an exception for the mother\\'s life, but you\\'re on the record as having objected to it. Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion, and with 83 percent of the American public in favor of a life exception, are you too out of the mainstream on this issue to win the general election?\\n\\n Governor Kasich, You chose to expand Medicaid in your state, unlike several other governors on this stage tonight, and it is already over budget by some estimates costing taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion in just the first 18 months.\\n\\nYou defended your Medicaid expansion by invoking God, saying to skeptics that when they arrive in heaven, Saint Peter isn\\'t going to ask them how small they\\'ve kept government, but what they have done for the poor.\\n\\nWhy should Republican voters, who generally want to shrink government, believe that you won\\'t use your Saint Peter rationale to expand every government program?\\n\\n Alright, gentlemen, we\\'re gonna switch topics now and talk a bit about terror and national security.\\n\\nGovernor Christie. You\\'ve said that Senator Paul\\'s opposition to the NSA\\'s collection of phone records has made the United States weaker and more vulnerable, even going so far as to say that he should be called before Congress to answer for it if we should be hit by another terrorist attack.\\n\\nDo you really believe you can assign blame to Senator Paul just for opposing the bulk collection of people\\'s phone records in the event of a terrorist attack?\\n\\n Go ahead, sir.\\n\\n Governor Christie, make your point.\\n\\n Go ahead, governor.\\n\\n Alright.\\n\\n Alright, we\\'ve gotta cut it off there.\\n\\nWe have plenty more we want to get to. That was an interesting exchange, thank you for that.\\n\\n Well, I want to move on, because I have -- we\\'re gonna get to you, governor, but I -- I really wanna get to a Facebook questioner. His name is Alex Chalgren, and he has the following question:\\n\\n[video clip begins]\\n\\n Senator Cruz, I wanna talk to you about this, because many of the Facebook users and -- and -- the -- the folks on Facebook wanted the candidates to speak to ISIS tonight.\\n\\nYou asked the chairman of the joint chiefs a question: \"What would it take to destroy ISIS in 90 days?\" He told you \"IISIS will only be truly destroyed once they are rejected by the populations in which they hide.\" And then you accused him of pushing Medicaid for the Iraqis.\\n\\nHow would you destroy ISIS in 90 days?\\n\\n You don\\'t see it as... [applause] ...an ideological problem -- an ideological problem in addition to a military one? [applause]\\n\\n Governor Bush, for days on end in this campaign, you struggled to answer a question about whether knowing what we know now...\\n\\n ...we would\\'ve invaded Iraq...\\n\\n I remember it too, and ISIS, of course, is now thriving there.\\n\\nYou finally said, \"No.\"\\n\\nTo the families of those who died in that war who say they liberated a country and deposed a ruthless dictator, how do you look at them now and say that your brothers war was a mistake?\\n\\n Governor Walker, in February you said that we needed to gain partners in the Arab world. Which Arab country not already in the U.S. led coalition has potential to be our greatest partner?\\n\\n Dr. Carson, in one of his first acts as commander in chief, President Obama signed an executive order banning enhanced interrogation techniques in fighting terror. As president, would you bring back water boarding?\\n\\n We have a lot for you, don\\'t worry. [laughter and applause] Fear not, you may rue that request.\\n\\n It\\'s just before 10:00 p.m. on the East Coast. Welcome back to Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, and the very first Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential campaign. Ten candidates on the stage, selected based on their standing in five national polls. And tonight they are facing off, answering the questions you want asked. We hope. [laughter]\\n\\n [off mike] Sounds like somebody\\'s a little R-rated. [applause]\\n\\n Well, the first debate night of the 2016 presidential campaign continues from Cleveland after a short time-out. Stick around. Social issues, next.\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\n You don\\'t favor a rape and incest exception?\\n\\n Mr. Trump, in 1999, you said you were, quote, \"very pro- choice.\" Even supporting partial-birth abortion. You favored an assault weapons ban as well. In 2004, you said in most cases you identified as a Democrat. Even in this campaign, your critics say you often sound more like a Democrat than a Republican, calling several of your opponents on the stage things like clowns and puppets. When did you actually become a Republican? [ catcalls]\\n\\n Governor Bush, I want to ask you, on the subject of name calling of your fellow candidates, a story appeared today quoting an anonymous GOP donor who said you called Mr. Trump a clown, a buffoon, something else that cannot be repeated on television.\\n\\n Is it true?\\n\\n Mr. Trump, 30 seconds.\\n\\n The subject of gay marriage and religious liberty. Governor Kasich, if you had a son or daughter who was gay or lesbian, how would you explain to them your opposition to same-sex marriage?\\n\\n How would you -- how would you explain it to a child?\\n\\n Senator Paul, in the wake of the Supreme Court\\'s ruling on same sex marriage, Carol Fox on Facebook want to know the following. Quote: what will you do to ensure Christians are not prosecuted for speaking out against gay marriage and will Christians be forced to conduct business that conflicts with their religious beliefs?\\n\\n Governor Walker, many in the Black Lives Matter movement, and beyond, believe that overly-aggressive police officers targeting young African Americans is the civil rights issue of our time. Do you agree? And if so, how do you plan to address it? And if not, why not?\\n\\n Thank you.\\n\\n We have to stand you by, because after the break, we\\'re going to let the candidates make their closing statements, their final thoughts, and . . . God.\\n\\nStay tuned for that.\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\n Governor Kasich, same question.\\n\\n Governor Walker, same question.\\n\\n Senator Rubio, I want to ask you the same question. But I do want to mention, a woman just came here to the stage and asked, what about the veterans? I want to hear more about what these candidates are going to do for our nation\\'s veterans.\\n\\nSo I put the question to you about God and the veterans, which you may find to be related.\\n\\n Dr. Carson, a question to you about God and his role, but also, one of the issues that the public was very interested in, and we touched on it earlier, is race relations in this country, and how divided we seem right now. And what, if anything, you can do -- you would do as the next president to help heal that divide.\\n\\n Governor Christie?\\n\\n Senator Ted Cruz.\\n\\n Governor Scott Walker.\\n\\n It\\'s over!\\n\\n Are you relieved? You were nervous before, they -- they don\\'t look relieved. They look \"get me outta here.\"\\n\\nThank you all very much, and that will do it for the first Republican primary debate night of the 2016 presidential race.

       " u'PAUL': [u' This is what\\'s wrong!\\n\\n I mean, this is what\\'s wrong. He buys and sells politicians of all stripes, he\\'s already...\\n\\n Hey, look, look! He\\'s already hedging his bet on the Clintons, OK? So if he doesn\\'t run as a Republican, maybe he supports Clinton, or maybe he runs as an independent...\\n\\n ...but I\\'d say that he\\'s already hedging his bets because he\\'s used to buying politicians.\\n\\n First of all, only ISIS is responsible for the terrorism. Only ISIS is responsible for the depravity. But, we do have to examine, how are we going to defeat ISIS?\\n\\nI\\'ve got a proposal. I\\'m the leading voice in America for not arming the allies of ISIS. [applause] I\\'ve been fighting amidst a lot of opposition from both Hillary Clinton, as well as some Republicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS. ISIS rides around in a billion dollars worth of U.S. Humvees. It\\'s a disgrace. We\\'ve got to stop -- we shouldn\\'t fund our enemies, for goodness sakes. So, we didn\\'t create ISIS -- ISIS created themselves, but we will stop them, and one of the ways we stop them is by not funding them, and not arming them. [applause]\\n\\n Megyn, may I respond? [applause] May I respond?\\n\\n I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from innocent Americans. The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over! John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence, and I\\'m proud of standing for the Bill of Rights, and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights. [applause]\\n\\n Use the Fourth Amendment!\\n\\n Use the Fourth Amendment!\\n\\n Get a warrant!\\n\\n Get a judge to sign the warrant!\\n\\n See, here\\'s the problem.\\n\\n Here\\'s the problem, governor. Here\\'s the problem, governor. You fundamentally misunderstand the Bill of Rights.\\n\\nEvery time you did a case, you got a warrant from a judge. I\\'m talking about searches without warrants...\\n\\n ...indiscriminately, of all Americans\\' records, and that\\'s what I fought to end.\\n\\nI don\\'t trust President Obama with our records. I know you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead. [applause]\\n\\n I\\'ve got a news flash...\\n\\n News flash, the Republican Party\\'s been fighting against a single-payer system...\\n\\n -- for a decade. So I think you\\'re on the wrong side of this if you\\'re still arguing for a single-payer system.\\n\\n I oppose the Iranian deal, and will vote against it. I don\\'t think that the president negotiated from a position of strength, but I don\\'t immediately discount negotiations.\\n\\nI\\'m a Reagan conservative. Reagan did negotiate with the Soviets. But you have to negotiate from a position of strength, and I think President Obama gave away too much, too early.\\n\\nIf there\\'s going to be a negotiation, you\\'re going to have to believe somehow that the Iranians are going to comply. And I asked this question to John Kerry, I said \"do you believe they\\'re trustworthy?\" and he said \"No.\"\\n\\nAnd I said, \"well, how are we gonna get them to comply?\" I would have never released the sanctions before there was consistent evidence of compliance.\\n\\n Look, I don\\'t want my marriage or my guns registered in Washington. And if people have an opinion, it\\'s a religious opinion that is heartly felt, obviously they should be allowed to practice that and no government should interfere with them. One of the things, one of the things that really got to me was the thing in Houston where you had the government, the mayor actually, trying to get the sermons of ministers. When the government tries to invade the church to enforce its own opinion on marriage, that\\'s when it\\'s time to resist.\\n\\n Well, let\\'s be clear, I\\'m the only one on the stage who actually has a five-year budget that balances. I\\'ve put pencil to paper...\\n\\n ... and I\\'ve said -- and I\\'ve said I would cut spending, and I\\'ve said exactly where. Each one of my budgets has taken a meat axe to foreign aid, because I think we ought to quit sending it to countries that hate us. [applause]\\n\\nI think we ought to quit sending it to countries that burn our flag. Israel is not one of those. But even Benjamin Netanyahu said that ultimately, they will be stronger when they\\'re independent. My position is exactly the same.\\n\\nWe shouldn\\'t borrow money from China to send it anywhere, but why don\\'t we start with eliminating aid to our enemies.\\n\\n I still say exactly what my original opinion is. Do you borrow money from China to send it to anyone? Out of your surplus, you can help your allies, and Israel is a great ally. And this is no particular animus of Israel, but what I will say, and I will say over and over again, we cannot give away money we don\\'t have.\\n\\nWe do not project power from bankruptcy court. We\\'re borrowing a million dollars a minute. [applause]\\n\\nIt\\'s got to stop somewhere.\\n\\n I\\'m a different kind of Republican. I\\'ve introduced a five-year balanced budget. I\\'ve introduced the largest tax cut in our history. I stood for ten and a half hours on the Senate floor to defend your right to be left alone. [applause]\\n\\nBut I\\'ve also gone to Chicago. I\\'ve gone to Detroit. I\\'ve been to Ferguson, I\\'ve been to Baltimore, because I want our party to be bigger, better and bolder, and I\\'m the only one that leads Hillary Clinton in five states that were won by President Obama. I\\'m a different kind of Republican. [applause]\\n\\n', u' Good evening, everyone. I\\'m an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky. My wife, Kelly, and I have been married for nearly 25 years, and I spend my days defending the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\\n\\nI think there\\'s nothing more important than understanding that the Constitution restrains government, not the people.\\n\\nThank you. [applause]\\n\\n I kind of have to laugh when I think of, \"Mmm, sounds like a non sequitur.\" He was asked whether or not he would be capable and it would be in good hands to be in charge of the nuclear weapons, and all of a sudden, there\\'s a sideways attack at me.\\n\\nI think that really goes to really the judgment. Do we want someone with that kind of character, that kind of careless language to be negotiating with Putin? Do we want someone like that to be negotiating with Iran?\\n\\nI think really there\\'s a sophomoric quality that is entertaining about Mr. Trump, but I am worried. I\\'m very concerned about him \\u2014 having him in charge of the nuclear weapons, because I think his response, his \\u2014 his visceral response to attack people on their appearance \\u2014 short, tall, fat, ugly \\u2014 my goodness, that happened in junior high. Are we not way above that? Would we not all be worried to have someone like that in charge of the nuclear arsenal?\\n\\n I think this goes back to essentially what we\\'ve been saying for the last two or three questions. Carly Fiorina also said we\\'re not going to talk with Putin. Well, think if Reagan had said that during the Cold War? We continued to talk with the Russians throughout the Cold War which is much more significant that where we are now.\\n\\nShould we continue to talk with Iran? Yes. Should we cut up the agreement immediately? That\\'s absurd. Wouldn\\'t you want to know if they complied? Now, I\\'m going to vote against the agreement because I don\\'t think there\\'s significant leverage, but it doesn\\'t mean that I would immediately not look at the agreement, and cut it up without looking to see if whether or not Iran has complied.\\n\\nThe same goes with China. I don\\'t think we need to be rash, I don\\'t think we need to be reckless, and I think need to leave lines of communication open. Often we talk about whether we should be engaged in the world, or disengaged in the world, and I think this is an example of some who want to isolate us, actually, and not be engaged.\\n\\nWe do need to be engaged with Russia. It doesn\\'t mean we give them a free pass, or China a free pass, but, to be engaged, to continue to talk. We did throughout the Cold War, and it would be a big mistake not to do it here.\\n\\n I think this gets to the point of wisdom on when to intervene and when we shouldn\\'t. Had we bombed Assad at the time, like President Obama wanted, and like Hillary Clinton wanted and many Republicans wanted, I think ISIS would be in Damascus today. I think ISIS would be in charge of Syria had we bombed Assad.\\n\\nSometimes both sides of the civil war are evil, and sometimes intervention sometimes makes us less safe. This is real the debate we have to have in the Middle East.\\n\\nEvery time we have toppled a secular dictator, we have gotten chaos, the rise of radical Islam, and we\\'re more at risk. So, I think we need to think before we act, and know most interventions, if not a lot of them in the Middle East, have actually backfired on us.\\n\\n Well, I hate to say it, but Donald Trump has a bit of a point here.\\n\\nThe case that was decided around 1900 was, people had a green card, were here legally, and they said that their children were citizens. There\\'s never been a direct Supreme Court case on people who were here illegally, whether or not their kids are citizens.\\n\\nSo it hasn\\'t really been completely adjudicated. The 14th Amendment says that \"those who are here and under the jurisdiction.\" The original author of the \\u2014 of the 14th Amendment said on the Senate floor that this was applying to slaves, and did not specifically apply to others.\\n\\n Well, I\\'m glad we\\'re having a discussion about taxes because everybody laments that we lose jobs overseas, we have. Our companies, and our jobs are being chased overseas by a 70,000 page tax code, so, that\\'s why I\\'ve chosen to get rid of the whole thing, and have one single rate, 14 and a-half percent for everybody, business, and for corporate income, and personal income. But, we also get rid of the payroll tax, so the working class would get a tax break as well.\\n\\nSo, I think a flat tax, eliminating the tax code, getting rid of all the loopholes, is the way to go, and it\\'s the way we get America going again.\\n\\n Hugh, can I \\u2014 can I make a response to that?\\n\\n Can I make a response to that?\\n\\n May I make a response to that?\\n\\n He\\'s referred to me.\\n\\n He\\'s referred to me...\\n\\n ... in his remarks. May I make a response?\\n\\n Absolutely. Go ahead.\\n\\n May I respond?\\n\\n The remark was made that there hadn\\'t been anyone else on the podium opposed to the Iraq War. I\\'ve made my career as being an opponent of the Iraq War. I was opposed to the Syria war. I was opposed to arming people who are our enemies.\\n\\nIran is now stronger because Hussein is gone. Hussein was the great bulwark and counterbalance to the Iranians. So when we complain about the Iranians, you need to remember that the Iraq War made it worse.\\n\\nOriginally, Governor Bush was asked, was the Iraq War a mistake, and he said, \"No. We\\'d do it again.\"\\n\\nWe have to learn sometimes the interventions backfire. The Iraq War backfired and did not help us. We\\'re still paying the repercussions of a bad decision.\\n\\n We have make the decision now in Syria, should we topple Assad? Many up here wanted to topple Assad, and it\\'s like \\u2014 I said no, because if you do...\\n\\n ... ISIS will now be in charge of Syria...\\n\\n If you want boots on the ground, and you want them to be our sons and daughters, you got 14 other choices. There will always be a Bush or Clinton for you, if you want to go back to war in Iraq.\\n\\nBut the thing is, the first war was a mistake. And I\\'m not sending our sons and our daughters back to Iraq. The war didn\\'t work. We can amplify those who live there.\\n\\nThe Kurds deserve to be armed and I\\'ll arm them. We can use our Air Force to amplify the forces there. But the boots on the ground need to be the people who live there.\\n\\nMy goodness, I\\'m still upset with the Saudi Arabians for everything they do over there. They\\'ve funded the arms that went to the jihadists. They\\'re not accepting any of the people, any of the migrants that have been \\u2014 the refugees that are being pushed out of Syria. Saudi Arabia is not accepting one.\\n\\nWhy are we always the world\\'s patsies that we have to go over there and fight their wars for them? They need to fight their wars, we need to defend American interests, but it is not in America\\'s national security interests to have another war in Iraq.\\n\\n I think one of the great problems, and what American people don\\'t like about politics, is hypocrisy. People have one standard for others and not for them \\u2014 for themselves.\\n\\nThere is at least one prominent example on the stage of someone who says they smoked pot in high school, and yet the people going to \\u2014 to jail for this are poor people, often African-Americans and often Hispanics, and yet the rich kids who use drugs aren\\'t.\\n\\nI personally think that this is a crime for which the only victim is the individual, and I think that America has to take a different attitude. I would like to see more rehabilitation and less incarceration. I\\'m a fan of the drug courts which try to direct you back towards work and less time in jail.\\n\\nBut the bottom line is the states. We say we like the 10th Amendment, until we start talking about this. And I think the federal government has gone too far, I think that the war on drugs has had a racial outcome, and really has been something that has really damaged our inner cities.\\n\\nNot only do the drugs damage them, we damage them again by incarcerating them and then preventing them from getting employment over time.\\n\\nSo I don\\'t think that the federal government should override the states. I believe in the 10th Amendment and I really will say that the states are left to themselves. [applause]\\n\\n Well, I think if we left it open, we could see how many people smoked pot in high school. [laughter]\\n\\n Well, you know, the thing is that...\\n\\n Yeah, I was talking about [inaudible] \\u2014 well, let me...\\n\\n But let me respond. The thing is, is that in Florida, Governor Bush campaigned against medical marijuana. That means that a small child like Morgan Hintz (ph) that has seizures is day, is failing on non-traditional medications, is not allowed to use cannabis oil.\\n\\nAnd if they do that in Florida, they will take the child away, they will put the parents in jail. And that\\'s what that means if you\\'re against allowing people use medical marijuana, you\\'ll actually put them in jail.\\n\\n And actually, under the current circumstances, kids who had privilege like you do, don\\'t go to jail, but the poor kids in our inner cities go to jail. I don\\'t think that\\'s fair. And I think we need to acknowledge it, and it is hypocritical to still want to put poor people in jail...\\n\\n Well, you vote \\u2014 you oppose medical marijuana...\\n\\n But that means you\\'ll put people in jail.\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n May I respond?\\n\\n Understand what they\\'re saying. if they\\'re going to say we are going to enforce the federal law against what the state law is, they aren\\'t really believing in the Tenth Amendment.\\n\\nGovernor Christie would go into Colorado, and if you\\'re breaking any federal law on marijuana, even though the state law allows it, he would put you in jail. If a young mother is trying to give her child cannabis oil for medical marijuana for seizure treatment, he would put her in jail, if it violates federal law.\\n\\nI would let Colorado do what the Tenth Amendment says. This power \\u2014 we were never intended to have crime dealing at the federal level. Crime was supposed to be left to the states. Colorado has made their decision. And I don\\'t want the federal government interfering and putting moms in jail, who are trying to get medicine for their kid...\\n\\n May I respond? May I respond?\\n\\n Here is the thing, he doesn\\'t want to make it about medical marijuana, but what if New Jersey\\'s medical marijuana contradicts the federal law? He\\'s saying he\\'ll send the federal government in, and he will enforce the federal law. That\\'s not consistent with the Tenth Amendment. It is not consistent with states\\' rights. And it is not consistent with the conservative vision for the country.\\n\\nI don\\'t think we should be sending the federal police in to arrest a mother and separate them from their child for giving a medicine to their child for seizures.\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n If you want a skeptic \\u2014 if you want a skeptic, Jake, I will happily jump into that briar patch. If you want a real...\\n\\n A second opinion? [laughter]\\n\\nOne of the greatest \\u2014 one of the greatest medical discoveries of all times was \\u2014 were the vaccines, particularly for smallpox. And if you want to read a story, it\\'s called The Speckled Monster, it\\'s an amazing story, it was all done voluntary.\\n\\nBut people came in by the droves. George Washington wouldn\\'t let his wife visit until she got vaccinated. So I\\'m all for vaccines. But I\\'m also for freedom.\\n\\nI\\'m also a little concerned about how they\\'re bunched up. My kids had all of their vaccines, and even if the science doesn\\'t say bunching them up is a problem, I ought to have the right to spread out my vaccines out a little bit at the very least.\\n\\n Ooh, that\\'s a tough one. You know, I\\'m big on \\u2014 that we were \\u2014 and I love what Carly said about women\\'s suffrage. I think Susan B. Anthony might be a good choice.\\n\\n Justice Never Sleeps. [laughter]\\n\\n I met Ronald Reagan as a teenager, and my family, we\\'re big supporters of him when he ran against Gerald Ford. It was a big deal because he was the grassroots, running against the establishment, and I\\'ll never forget that. And, how he stood up and said, you know what, this is something new that our country needs, and our party needs.\\n\\nIf I were president, I would try to be one who says, you know what, I\\'m a Reagan Conservative. I\\'m someone who believes in peace through strength, and I would try to lead the country in that way knowing that our goal is peace, and that war is the last resort, not the first resort. And, that when we go to war, we go to war in a constitutional way, which means that we have to vote on it, that war is initiated by congress, not by the president, that we go to war electively (ph). That when we go to war, we don\\'t fight with one arm tied behind our back, we fight all out to win, but then we come home. [applause]\\n\\n', ...],\n",

       " u'RUBIO': [u\" Well, thank you for the question, Chris, and it's great to be here tonight. Let me begin by saying this: I'm not new to the political process; I was making a contribution as the speaker of the third largest and most diverse state in the country well before I even got into the Senate.\\n\\nI would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition. It's important to be qualified, but if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton's gonna be the next president, because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight.\\n\\nHere's what this election better be about: This election better be about the future, not the past. It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced.\\n\\nThis country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed. You know, the largest retailer in the country and the world today, Amazon, doesn't even own a single store? And these changes have been disruptive. They have changed people's lives. The jobs that once sustained our middle class, they either don't pay enough or they are gone, and we need someone that understands that as our nominee.\\n\\nIf I'm our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised paycheck to paycheck. How is she -- how is she gonna lecture me -- how is she gonna lecture me about student loans? I owed over $100,000 just four years ago.\\n\\nIf I'm our nominee, we will be the party of the future. [applause]\\n\\n Let me set the record straight on a couple of things. The first is, the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico. They're coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras. Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority.\\n\\nI also believe we need a fence. The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too. And that's why you need an e-verify system and you need an entry-exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration. But I agree with what Governor Kasich just said. People are frustrated. This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like we're being taken advantage of. We feel like despite our generosity, we're being taken advantage of.\\n\\nAnd let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates. The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States. And they've paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can't get in. And they're wondering, maybe they should come illegally. [applause]\\n\\nAnd so these are important issues, and we should address it. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and otherwise we're going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years, like we have for the last 30 years.\\n\\n Not me.\\n\\n Actually, to be clear...[crosstalk]...he supported Charlie Crist.\\n\\n Hey, Charlie...[crosstalk]\\n\\n Well, first off, I too believe in curriculum reform. It is critically important in the 21st Century. We do need curriculum reform. And it should happen at the state and local level. That's. . . that's. . . that is where educational policy belongs, because if a parent is unhappy with what their child is being taught in school, they can go to that local school board or their state legislature, or their governor and get it changed.\\n\\nHere's the problem with Common Core. The Department of Education, like every federal agency, will never be satisfied. They will not stop with it being a suggestion. They will turn it into a mandate.\\n\\nIn fact, what they will begin to say to local communities is, you will not get federal money unless do you things the way we want you to do it. And they will use Common Core or any other requirements that exists nationally to force it down the throats of our people in our states. [applause]\\n\\n That's a great question.\\n\\n That's a great question.\\n\\nFirst of all, it begins by having leaders that recognize that the economy we live in today is dramatically different from the one we had five years ago. It's an economy that now has placed us in global competition with dozens of other countries around the world.\\n\\nNow, the big companies that have connections with Washington, they can affect policies to help them, but the small companies like the one Tania is talking about, they're the ones that are struggling.\\n\\nThe first thing we need to do is we need to even out the tax code for small businesses so that we lower their tax rate to 25 percent, just as we need to lower it for all businesses.\\n\\nWe need to have a regulatory budget in America that limits the amount of regulations on our economy. We need to repeal and replace Obamacare and we need to improve higher education so that people can have access to the skills they need for 21st century jobs.\\n\\nAnd last but not least, we need to repeal Dodd-Frank. It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks. [applause] 20 \\u2014 over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out over the \\u2014 since Dodd-Frank has passed. We need to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank. We need to make America fair again for all businesses, but especially those being run by small business owners.\\n\\n Well, Megyn, first of all, I'm not sure that that's a correct assessment of my record. I would go on to add that I believe all--\\n\\n I have never said that. And I have never advocated that. What I have advocated is that we pass law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection.\\n\\nIn fact, I think that law already exists. It is called the Constitution of the United States. [applause]\\n\\nAnd let me go further. I believe that every single human being is entitled to the protection of our laws, whether they can vote or not. Whether they can speak or not. Whether they can hire a lawyer or not. Whether they have a birth certificate or not. And I think future generations will look back at this history of our country and call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies who we never gave them a chance to live. [applause]\\n\\n Well, first, let me say I think God has blessed us. He has blessed the Republican Party with some very good candidates. The Democrats can't even find one. [laughter] [cheering and applause]\\n\\nAnd I believe God has blessed our country. This country has been extraordinarily blessed. And we have honored that blessing. And that's why God has continued to bless us.\\n\\nAnd he has blessed us with young men and women willing to risk their lives and sometimes die in uniform for the safety and security of our people.\\n\\nUnfortunately today we have a VA that does not do enough for them. I am proud that last year we helped change the law. We changed the law to give the power to the VA secretary the ability to fire any executive that isn't doing their job.\\n\\nAnd it is outrageous they've only fired one person to date. When I'm president of the United States, we're going to have a VA that cares more about our veterans than about the bureaucrats who work at the VA. [cheering and applause]\\n\\n Thank you. You know, both of my parents were born into poor families on the island of Cuba. They came to America because it was the only place where people like them could have a chance. Here in this country, they never made it big, but the very purpose of their life was to give us the chance to do all the things they never could.\\n\\nMy father was a bartender. And the journey from the back of that bar to this stage tonight, to me, that is the essence of the American dream. It is what makes our nation different. And I'm running for president because I want that to still be possible for the people trying to do that now. I run for president because I believe that we can't just save the American dream; we can expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And that's why I'm asking for your vote. So we can make America greater than it has ever been. And make of this century a new American century. [applause]\\n\\n\", u' Thank you. My name is Marco Rubio. I\\'m from Florida. My wife Jeanette and I are the proud \\u2014 we\\'ve been married 17 years, and we\\'re the proud parents of four children, two of whom were able to join us here this evening.\\n\\nI\\'m honored to be here at the Reagan Library, at a place that honors the legacy of a man who inspired not just my interest in public service, but also our love for country.\\n\\nAnd I\\'m also aware that California has a drought, and so that\\'s why I made sure I brought my own water. [laughter]\\n\\n Well, first of all, I have an understanding of exactly what it is Russia and Putin are doing, and it\\'s pretty straightforward. He wants to reposition Russia, once again, as a geopolitical force.\\n\\nHe himself said that the destruction of the Soviet Union \\u2014 the fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, and now he\\'s trying to reverse that.\\n\\nHe\\'s trying to destroy NATO. And this is what this is a part of. He is exploiting a vacuum that this administration has left in the Middle East.\\n\\nHere\\'s what you\\'re gonna see in the next few weeks: the Russians will begin to fly \\u2014 fly combat missions in that region, not just targeting ISIS, but in order to prop up Assad.\\n\\nHe will also, then, turn to other countries in the region and say, \"America is no longer a reliable ally, Egypt. America is no longer a reliable ally, Saudi Arabia. Begin to rely on us.\"\\n\\nWhat he is doing is he is trying to replace us as the single most important power broker in the Middle East, and this president is allowing it. That is what is happening in the Middle East. That\\'s what\\'s happening with Russia, and...\\n\\n Let me tell you \\u2014 I will tell you we have zero responsibility, because let\\'s remember what the president said. He said the attack he would conduct would be a pinprick. Well, the United States military was not build to conduct pinprick attacks.\\n\\nIf the United States military is going to be engaged by a commander-in-chief, it should only be engaged in an endeavor to win. And we\\'re not going to authorize use of force if you\\'re not put in a position where they can win.\\n\\nAnd quite frankly, people don\\'t trust this president as commander-in-chief because of that. [applause]\\n\\n Hold on, a second, Jake, he asked me, as well. I\\'d like to actually...\\n\\n ... respond. I think I\\'m the first senator. [laughter]\\n\\nThe No. 1 test for use of military force should be the vital national security interest of the United States. The reason why I opposed President Obama bombing Syria, is because he couldn\\'t answer the question what do you do if chemical weapons end up in the hands of radical Islamic terrorists like al-Nusra, like Al Qaida, like ISIS?\\n\\nNow, I also want to respond to several folks up here who said we should trust this Iranian deal, see if the Iranians will comply.\\n\\nAnyone who is paying attention to what Khamenei says knows that they will not comply. There is a reason Khamenei refers to Israel as the little Satan, and America as the great Satan.\\n\\n Ms. Dana, I agree that English is the unifying language of our country, and everyone should learn to speak it. It\\'s important.\\n\\nI want to tell you a story about someone that didn\\'t speak English that well. It was my grandfather; he came to this country in the 1960s, as a \\u2014 escaping Cuba. And he lived with us, growing up.\\n\\nAnd my grandfather loved America. He understood what was so special about this country. He loved Ronald Reagan; he would be very proud of the fact that we\\'re here this evening.\\n\\nMy grandfather instilled in me the belief that I was blessed to live in the one society in all of human history where even I, the son of a bartender and a maid, could aspire to have anything, and be anything that I was willing to work hard to achieve.\\n\\nBut he taught me that in Spanish, because it was the language he was most comfortable in. And he became a conservative, even though he got his news in Spanish.\\n\\nAnd so, I do give interviews in Spanish, and here\\'s why \\u2014 because I believe that free enterprise and limited government is the best way to help people who are trying to achieve upward mobility.\\n\\nAnd if they get their news in Spanish, I want them to hear that directly from me. Not from a translator at Univision.\\n\\n Well, let me say that legal immigration is not an issue I read about in the newspaper. Immigration, illegal immigration, all the good aspects of immigration and all the negative ones as well, I live with. My family\\'s immigrants. My neighbors are all immigrants. My in-laws are all immigrants.\\n\\nSo I\\'ve seen every aspect of it, and I can tell you America doesn\\'t have one immigration problem, it has three.\\n\\nFirst, despite the fact that we are the most generous country in the history of the world in allowing people to come here legally, we have people still coming illegally.\\n\\nSecond, we have a legal immigration system that no longer works. It primary is built on the basis of whether you have a relative living here instead of merit.\\n\\nAnd third, we have 11 million or 12 million people, many of whom have been here for longer than a decade who are already here illegally.\\n\\nAnd we must deal with all three of these problems. We cannot deal with all three of these problems in one massive piece of legislation. I learned that. We tried it that way.\\n\\nHere\\'s the way forward: First, we must \\u2014 we must secure our border, the physical border, with \\u2014 with a wall, absolutely. But we also need to have an entry/exit tracking system. 40 percent of the people who come here illegally come legally, and then they overstay the visa. We also need a mandatory e-verify system.\\n\\nAfter we\\'ve done that, step two would be to modernize our legal immigration system so you come to America on the basis of what you can contribute economically, not whether or not simply you have a relative living here.\\n\\nAnd after we\\'ve done those two things, I believe the American people...\\n\\n ... will be very reasonable and responsible about what you do with someone who\\'s been here and isn\\'t a criminal. If you\\'re a criminal, obviously, you will not be able to stay.\\n\\n Yes, well, it does. But it\\'s in the following way, this is an important question. I think if you\\'re running for president, these are important issues, because look at around the world today.\\n\\nThere is a lunatic in North Korea with dozens of nuclear weapons and long-range rocket that can already hit the very place in which we stand tonight. The Chinese are rapidly expanding their military. They hack into our computers. They\\'re building artificial islands in the South China Sea, the most important shipping lane in the world.\\n\\nA gangster in Moscow is not just threatening Europe, he\\'s threatening to destroy and divide NATO. You have radical jihadists in dozens of countries across multiple continents. And they even recruit Americans using social media to try to attack us here at home.\\n\\nAnd now we have got this horrible deal with Iran where a radical Shia cleric with an apocalyptic vision of the future is also guaranteed to one day possess nuclear weapons and also a long-range rocket that can hit the United States.\\n\\nThese are extraordinarily dangerous times that we live in. And the next president of the United States better be someone that understands these issues and has good judgment about them because the number one issue that a president will ever confront, and the most important obligation that the federal government has, is to keep this nation safe.\\n\\nAnd today we are not doing that. We are eviscerating our military. And we have a president that is more respectful to the ayatollah in Iran than he is to the prime minister of Israel. [applause]\\n\\n Well, that\\'s why we have a debate. I think that we should have a deeper debate about these issues, because there is no more important decision that a president will make.\\n\\n Well, you should ask him questions in detail about the foreign policy issues our president will confront, because you had better be able to lead our country on the first day.\\n\\nNot six months from now, not a year from now, on the first day in office, our president could very well confront a national security crisis. You can\\'t predict it. Sometimes you cannot control it.\\n\\nAnd it is the most \\u2014 the federal government does all kinds of things it\\'s not supposed to be doing. It regulates bathrooms. It regulates schools that belong to local communities.\\n\\nBut the one thing that the federal government must do, the one thing that only the federal government can do is keep us safe. And a president better be up-to-date on those issues on his first day in office, on her first day in office. [applause]\\n\\n Trust (ph) me, I get that. OK.\\n\\n I never get to addressed, and...\\n\\n ...and when I do, I\\'m gonna jump in.\\n\\n Yeah. He did. Let me \\u2014 I\\'m proud to serve in the United States Senate. You know, when I ran five years ago, the entire leadership of my party in Washington lined up against me.\\n\\nBut I\\'m glad I won. And I\\'m glad that I ran, because this country\\'s headed in the wrong direction. And if we keep electing the same people, nothing is going to change.\\n\\nAnd you\\'re right, I have missed some votes, and I\\'ll tell you why, Mr. Trump. Because in my years in the Senate, I\\'ve figured out very quickly that the political establishment in Washington, D.C. in both political parties is completely out of touch with the lives of our people.\\n\\nYou have millions of people in this country living paycheck to paycheck, and nothing is being done about it. We are about to leave our children with $18 trillion in \\u2014 in \\u2014 in debt, and they\\'re about to raise the debt limit again.\\n\\nWe have a world that grows increasingly dangerous, and we are eviscerating our military spending and signing deals with Iran. And these \\u2014 if this thing continues, we are going to be the first Americans to leave our children worse off than ourselves.\\n\\nThat\\'s why I\\'m missing votes. Because I am leaving the Senate, I\\'m not running for re-election, and I\\'m running for president because I know this: unless we have the right president, we cannot make America fulfill its potential, but with the right person in office, the 21st century can be the greatest era that our nation has ever known.\\n\\n I want to go even deeper \\u2014 and I want to go even deeper in that direction, because I think the belief that somehow by retreating, America makes the world safer has been disproven every single time it\\'s ever been tried.\\n\\nSyria\\'s a perfect example of it. The uprising in Syria was not started by the United States; it was started by the Syrian people. And I warned at the time \\u2014 this was three and a half years ago \\u2014 I openly and repeatedly warned that if we did not find moderate elements on the ground that we could equip and arm, that void would be filled by radical jihadists.\\n\\nWell, the president didn\\'t listen, the administration didn\\'t follow through, and that\\'s exactly what happened. That is why ISIS grew. That is why ISIS then came over the border from Syria and back into Iraq.\\n\\nWhat is happening in that region is the direct consequence of the inability to lead and of disengagement. And the more we disengage, the more airplanes from Moscow you\\'re going to see flying out of Damascus and out of Syria...\\n\\n ... as you asked earlier today. [applause]\\n\\n But radical terrorism cannot be solved by intellect. It cannot \\u2014 they require \\u2014 what they need, is they need an operating space. That\\'s what Afghanistan was for Al Qaida. It was a vacuum that they filled, and they created an operating space.\\n\\nThat\\'s why they had to be drawn out of there. That\\'s why they had to be destroyed. It is the reason why ISIS has grown as well. We allowed them \\u2014 we allowed a vacuum to emerge in Syria. They used it as an operating space to grow; and today they\\'re not just in Iraq and Syria anymore, they\\'re now in Libya, conducting operations in the Sinai.\\n\\nThey\\'re now in Afghanistan, trying to supplant the Taliban as the most powerful radical jihadist group on the ground there, as well. You cannot allow radical jihadists to have an operating safe haven anywhere in the world.\\n\\n There\\'s a broader issue here, Hugh. And there\\'s a broader issue here as well.\\n\\nFirst of all, the only people that follow the law are law-abiding people. Criminals by definition ignore the law, so you can pass all the gun laws in the world, like the left wants. The criminals are going to ignore it because they are criminals.\\n\\nHere\\'s the real issue. [applause]\\n\\nThe real issue \\u2014 the real issue is not what are people using to commit violence, but why are they committing the violence? And here\\'s the truth: Because you cannot separate the social, moral wellbeing of your people from their economic and other wellbeing. You cannot separate it.\\n\\nYou can\\'t have a strong country without strong people, you cannot have strong people without strong values, and you cannot have strong values without strong families and the institutions in this country that defend and support those families.\\n\\n Well, and today, we have a left-wing government under this president that is undermining all of the institutions and society that support the family and teach those values.\\n\\n Because we\\'re not going to destroy our economy the way the left-wing government that we are under now wants to do. We\\'re not going to...\\n\\n Well, and I don\\'t \\u2014 he may have lined up with their positions on this issue. But here is the bottom line. Every proposal they put forward are going to be proposals that will make it harder to do business in America, that will make it harder to create jobs in America.\\n\\nSingle parents are already struggling across this country to provide for their families. Maybe a billionaire here in California can afford an increase in their utility rates, but a working family in Tampa, Florida, or anywhere across this country cannot afford it.\\n\\nSo we are not going to destroy our economy. We are not going to make America a harder place to create jobs in order to pursue policies that will do absolutely nothing, nothing to change our climate, to change our weather, because America is a lot of things, the greatest country in the world, absolutely.\\n\\nBut America is not a planet. And we are not even the largest carbon producer anymore, China is. And they\\'re drilling a hole and digging anywhere in the world that they can get a hold of.\\n\\nSo the bottom line is, I am not in favor of any policies that make America a harder place for people to live, or to work, or to raise their families. [applause]\\n\\n Jake, you mentioned me and called me a denier. Let me say, climate change...\\n\\n OK. A skeptic. You can measure the climate. You can measure it. That\\'s not the issue we\\'re discussing. Here is what I\\'m skeptical of. I\\'m skeptical of the decisions that the left wants us to make, because I know the impact those are going to have and they\\'re all going to be on our economy.\\n\\nThey will not do a thing to lower the rise of the sea. They will not do a thing to cure the drought here in California. But what they will do is they will make America a more expensive place to create jobs.\\n\\nAnd today with millions of people watching this broadcast that are struggling paycheck to paycheck that do not know how they\\'re going to pay their bills at the end of this month, I\\'m not in favor of anything that is going to make it harder for them to raise their family.\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n Senator Rubio, you mean?\\n\\n I know we all look alike. [laughter]\\n\\n The \\u2014 Rosa Parks, an everyday American that changed the course of history.\\n\\n Well, there are some people in Florida upset at me over a joke I made about Florida State, but, what the heck, I want my codename to be Gator. [laughter] [applause]\\n\\n One of the things that made Ronald Reagan a great president, is that he understood that America was a unique nation, like any other that had existed throughout human history. He knew it was founded on universal principles that were powerful, the dignity of all people, human rights, the rights of all to live in freedom and liberty, and choose their own path in life. He didn\\'t just believe it, he acted on it. That\\'s why bringing down communism was so important to him. If I\\'m honored with the opportunity to be president, I hope that our Air Force One will fly, first and foremost, to our allies; in Israel, in South Korea, and Japan. They know we stand with them. That America can be counted on.\\n\\nIt would also fly to China, not just to meet with our enemies, not just to meet with those adversaries of ours that are there, but also to meet with those that aspire to freedom and liberty within China. I would even invite them to my inauguration.\\n\\nWe would also fly into Moscow and into Russia. And not just meet with the leaders of Russia, but also meet with those who aspire to freedom and liberty in Russia. And ultimately, I hope that my Air Force One, if I become president, will one day land in a free Cuba, where its people can choose its leaders and its own destiny. [applause]\\n\\n', ...],\n",

       " u'TAPPER': [u'', u' I\\'m Jake Tapper. We\\'re live at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California for the main event. Round 2 of CNN\\'s presidential debate starts now.\\n\\nThe eleven leading Republican candidates for president are at their podiums. They are ready to face off, and if you\\'ve been watching this race, you know anything could happen over the next few hours.\\n\\nTo viewers who are just joining us, welcome to the Air Force One Pavilion of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Our thanks to the staff here and especially to former first lady Nancy Reagan for this impressive setting with Ronald Reagan\\'s presidential plane as our backdrop. [applause]\\n\\nThis debate is airing on CNN networks in the United States and around the world. It\\'s also being broadcast on the Salem Radio Network. I know everyone is very eager to get started.\\n\\nBut first, I want to explain the ground rules tonight. My name is Jake Tapper. I\\'ll be the moderator. I will be joined in the questioning by Salem Radio Network talk show host Hugh Hewitt. He worked in the Reagan administration for six years. And by CNN\\'s chief political correspondent Dana Bash.\\n\\nI will ask follow-up questions, I will attempt to guide the discussion. Candidates, I will try to make sure each of you gets your fair share of questions. You\\'ll have one minute to answer and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals. I\\'ll give you time to respond if you\\'ve been singled out for criticism.\\n\\nOur viewers should know we have timing lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up. These 11 Republicans are positioned on the stage based on their ranking in recent national polls.\\n\\nOur goal for this evening is a debate. A true debate, with candidates addressing each other in areas where they differ. Where they disagree \\u2014 on policy, on politics, on leadership. Now, let\\'s begin.\\n\\nI\\'d like to invite each candidate to take 30 seconds to introduce him or herself to our audience. First to you, Senator Paul.\\n\\n Senator Cruz?\\n\\n Thank you one and all for being here. There are many important policy issues facing our nation. We\\'re going to get to many of them tonight, but I do want to start off with some current events in the news, and also some of the comments the candidates have recently made on the campaign trail.\\n\\nMrs. Fiorina, I want to start with you. Fellow Republican candidate, and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, has suggested that your party\\'s frontrunner, Mr. Donald Trump, would be dangerous as President. He said he wouldn\\'t want, quote, \"such a hot head with his finger on the nuclear codes.\"\\n\\nYou, as well, have raised concerns about Mr. Trump\\'s temperament.\\n\\nYou\\'ve dismissed him as an entertainer. Would you feel comfortable with Donald trump\\'s finger on the nuclear codes?\\n\\n You didn\\'t answer my question. Would you feel comfortable with Donald Trump\\'s finger on the nuclear codes? It\\'s an issue that one of your fellow candidates has raised.\\n\\n Mr. Trump? [applause]\\n\\n Mr. \\u2014 Senator Paul, your name has been invoked.\\n\\n Mr. Trump? [applause]\\n\\n I want to \\u2014 I want to give Mr. Trump...\\n\\n ... Mr. Trump, I want to give you another chance \\u2014 Mr. Trump, I want to give you a chance to respond to something that your rival to your left, Governor Bush, said.\\n\\nGovernor Bush told me last week when I read him the quote from Governor Jindal that he agrees you\\'re not a serious candidate.\\n\\nTell Governor Bush why you are a serious candidate and what your qualifications are to be commander-in-chief.\\n\\n Governor Bush, would you feel comfortable with Donald Trump\\'s finger on the nuclear codes?\\n\\n Governor Walker?\\n\\n Let\\'s move on. [applause]\\n\\n A phenomenon going on in the race right now is the political...\\n\\nOK, Governor Kasich, go ahead.\\n\\n We have a lot of issues coming up, sir.\\n\\n We are getting to the issues, sir. [applause]\\n\\nPhenomenon going on in the race is the political outsiders in the race, Dr. Carson, Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina, all together, have majority support in the polls.\\n\\nGovernor Christie, I want to ask you about something that Dr. Carson said the other day.\\n\\nDr. Carson said campaigning is easier for him, because he\\'s not a politician. He can just tell the truth, therefore, while politicians, quote, \"Have their finger in the air to see and do what is politically expedient.\"\\n\\nGovernor Christie, tell Dr. Carson, is that a fair description of you?\\n\\n Well, let\\'s find out. Thank you.\\n\\n Thank you, Governor Christie.\\n\\nDr. Carson, who were you thinking about on this stage when you said that?\\n\\n And more broadly, is experience in government not important for a president to have?\\n\\n Thank you, Dr. Carson.\\n\\n Thank you.\\n\\n Thank you. Thank you Ms. Fiorina. [applause]\\n\\nGovernor Bush, in addition to the fact that he\\'s an outsider, one of the reasons Mr. Trump is a frontrunner, Republican voters say, is because they like the fact that he is not bought and paid for by wealthy donors. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that the $100 million you\\'ve raised for your campaign makes you a puppet for your donors. Are you?\\n\\n Is there anything else you want to say about this?\\n\\n Governor \\u2014\\n\\n Sure Dr. Carson.\\n\\n Thank you, Dr. Carson. Let\\'s move to Russia if we could.\\n\\nRussia is sending troops and tanks into Syria right now to prop up a U.S. enemy, Bashar al-Assad. President Obama\\'s incoming top general says, quote, \"Russia presents the greatest threat to our national security.\"\\n\\nMr. Trump, you say you can do business with President Vladimir Putin, you say you will get along, quote, \"very well.\" What would you do right now if you were president, to get the Russians out of Syria?\\n\\n So, you \\u2014 just to clarify, the only answer I heard to the question I asked is that you would \\u2014 you would reach out to Vladimir Putin, and you would do what? You would...\\n\\n Senator Rubio, you\\'ve taken a very different approach to the \\u2014 the question of Russia. You\\'ve called Vladimir Putin a, quote, \"gangster.\"\\n\\nWhy would President Rubio\\'s approach be more effective than President Trump\\'s?\\n\\n Thank you, Senator Rubio.\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n Ms. Fiorina, you have met...\\n\\n ...yeah, you\\'ve met Vladimir Putin. Yes.\\n\\n Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.\\n\\n Thank you.\\n\\n Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.\\n\\nWhile you\\'re \\u2014 while you brought up the subject of General Suleimani of the Quds forces from Iran, the next president, no matter who he or she may be, will inherit President Obama\\'s Iran deal.\\n\\nSenator Cruz, Governor Kasich says that anyone who is promising to rip up the Iran deal on day one, as you have promised to do, is, quote, \"inexperienced,\" and, quote, \"playing to a crowd.\" Respond to Governor Kasich, please.\\n\\n Why is that not, as Governor Kasich says, playing to the crowd and an example of you being inexperienced?\\n\\n Governor Kasich...\\n\\n ...Did Senator Cruz just play to the crowd?\\n\\n ...Thank you, Governor. I want to go to Senator Paul.\\n\\nTRUMP(?): ...Slow (ph) and steady, [inaudible] chicken...\\n\\n Governor Walker, Senator Paul seemed to suggest... [applause]\\n\\n ...Governor Bush...\\n\\nCRUZ(?): ...Jake...\\n\\n I want to turn...\\n\\n ...I want to turn to Governor Huckabee who has been very patient. Somebody had to be 11th, and he is, but, I do want to change the subject to the event that you had...\\n\\n ... however you want, but I want to ask this question.\\n\\n All right, sir, go ahead.\\n\\n OK.\\n\\n(UNKNOWN): Jake, I\\'d like to...\\n\\n Thank you, Senator Paul. [applause]\\n\\nI want to turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.\\n\\n That would be fair, you\\'re right. You\\'re the third senator.\\n\\n We\\'re going to go to Dana Bash...\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n Senator Cruz?\\n\\n Thank you, Senator.\\n\\n Thank you, Senator.\\n\\n Thank you, Senator. I want to...\\n\\n ... turn back to Governor Huckabee...\\n\\n I want to turn back to Governor Huckabee.\\n\\nGovernor Huckabee, last week, you held a rally for a county clerk in Kentucky who was jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, as I don\\'t need to tell you.\\n\\nYou\\'ve called what happened to Kim Davis, that clerk, \"an example of the criminalization of Christianity.\" There are several people on the stage who disagree with you.\\n\\nGovernor Bush, for example, says that that clerk is sworn to uphold the law. Is Governor Bush on the wrong side of the criminalization of Christianity?\\n\\n Thank you, Governor.\\n\\n Well, I\\'m not telling you that, Governor. But Governor Bush is, because he \\u2014 because he disagrees. He thinks that Kim Davis swore to uphold the law.\\n\\nYou disagree? You\\'re not \\u2014 you don\\'t...\\n\\n OK. Please do.\\n\\n You did...\\n\\n Governor, you said, quote, \"she is sworn to uphold the law.\"\\n\\n Let me go to my colleague Dana Bash, who has a question.\\n\\n Dana, I want to continue on the subject.\\n\\nGovernor Bush, you recently said while discussing Planned Parenthood, quote, you\\'re \"not sure we need a half billion for women\\'s health issues.\" Now you\\'ve since said that you misspoke, you didn\\'t mean to say \"women\\'s health issues.\"\\n\\nBut Donald Trump said that quote, that comment, which Hillary Clinton did seize upon immediately, will haunt you the same way Mitt Romney\\'s 47 percent video haunted him.\\n\\nTell Donald Trump why he\\'s wrong.\\n\\n Thank you, Governor Bush.\\n\\nDonald Trump, let me just...\\n\\n The quote was, \"I\\'m not sure we need half a billion dollars for women\\'s health issues.\" He said he misspoke. You said that that\\'s going to haunt him. Why do you think that?\\n\\n Governor Bush?\\n\\n I want to \\u2014 we\\'re going to get to \\u2014\\n\\n Thank you, Governor.\\n\\n Thank you, Governor.\\n\\n We\\'re going to \\u2014 we\\'re going to get to many of these issues. This \\u2014 we\\'re still in the first block, believe it or not. We\\'re going to get to many of these issues, but before we end this block, Ms. Fiorina, I do want to ask you about this.\\n\\nIn an interview last week in Rolling Stone magazine, Donald Trump said the following about you. Quote, \"Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?\" Mr. Trump later said he was talking about your persona, not your appearance. Please feel free to respond what you think about his persona. [laughter]\\n\\n All right. On that note, in less than two minutes \\u2014 we\\'re going to take a very quick break. In less than two minutes, the most contentious issue on the campaign trail. And the candidates on the stage are split over how to handle it. That\\'s coming up next.\\n\\nPlease give some applause to the candidates. [applause]\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\n Governor Christie, you and I have talked about this in an interview. You say that his big wall, his plan to deport 11 to 12 million undocumented immigrants, it sounds great, but it\\'s never going to happen.\\n\\nTell him why you\\'re skeptical of his plans?\\n\\n Thank you, Governor Christie...\\n\\n I want to bring in Dr. Carson because he too has been skeptical of your plan to immediately deport 11 to 12 million illegal immigrants. He said, quote, \"People who say that have no idea what this entails.\"\\n\\nWhy do you say that, Dr. Carson?\\n\\n ...Dr. Carson...\\n\\n With all due respect, you said about Donald Trump\\'s plan to deport 11 to 12 million undocumented immigrants, \"People who say that have no idea what this entails.\"\\n\\nWhy not?\\n\\n ...let\\'s continue the conversation about illegal immigration with Dana Bash.\\n\\n Thank you, Senator Rubio. [applause]\\n\\nSenator Cruz \\u2014 Senator Cruz, this week, we learned more about Dr. Carson\\'s plan for the 11 million to 12 million undocumented immigrants in this country.\\n\\nDr. Carson proposed giving these undocumented immigrants a six- month grace period to pay back taxes then to let them become guest workers and only to deport people who failed to do that.\\n\\n Well, how would you say it, sir? I was just reading the Wall Street Journal quote, but please tell us.\\n\\n OK, from the horse\\'s mouth, Senator Cruz, does that fit your definition of amnesty?\\n\\n Thank you, Senator.\\n\\nSenator Rubio...\\n\\n ... I\\'m not sure...\\n\\n We\\'ll come back to you \\u2014 we\\'ll come back to you in one second, sir.\\n\\nBut Senator Rubio, I\\'m not sure exactly whose plan he\\'s \\u2014 he\\'s saying is \\u2014 constitutes amnesty, but I know he has said it about your plan in the past, so I want to give you a chance to respond, then, Dr. Carson, we\\'ll come to you.\\n\\n Thank you, Senator.\\n\\n Thank you, Senator.\\n\\nSenator \\u2014 Dr. Carson... [applause] ... I want to give you 30 seconds. I\\'d like you to answer the question.\\n\\nSenator Cruz describes plans such as yours as amnesty. Why is your plan not amnesty?\\n\\n Thank you, Dr. Carson. I want to talk about the issue of birthright citizenship, which \\u2014 which has emerged since the first debate as \\u2014 as an a \\u2014 a major issue in this campaign.\\n\\nMr. Trump, you say that babies born in the United States to undocumented immigrants should not any longer get automatic American citizenship. Ms. Fiorina says that you are pandering on this issue and acting like the politicians that you rail against. What\\'s your message to Ms. Fiorina on birthright citizenship?\\n\\n Ms. Fiorina, the vast majority of countries do not have birthright citizenship... [applause] ...Donald Trump is right about that. Why is it pandering when he\\'s \\u2014 he says this?\\n\\n Ms. Fiorina...\\n\\n Please.\\n\\n Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.\\n\\n Thank you.\\n\\n Thank you, Ms. Fiorina. Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond...\\n\\n Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Paul...\\n\\n Senator Paul, I want to bring you in. Where \\u2014 where do you stand on the issue of birthright citizenship?\\n\\n All right. Senator Paul, thank you so much. Let\\'s turn to a new topic. We\\'ve received a lot of questions on social media about the economy and about jobs. We have two CEOs on stage right now.\\n\\nMs. Fiorina, you were CEO of Hewlett Packard. Donald Trump says you, quote, \"ran HP into the ground,\" you laid off tens of thousands of people, you got viciously fired.\\n\\nFor voters looking to somebody with private-sector experience to create American jobs, why should they pick you and not Donald Trump?\\n\\n Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.\\n\\n Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.\\n\\n Mr. Trump \\u2014 Mr. Trump, why would you be better at creating jobs than Carly Fiorina?\\n\\n Ms. Fiorina, I want to give you a chance to respond.\\n\\n Mr. Trump.\\n\\n Thank you, Mr. Trump.\\n\\n Governor Christie\\'s name has been invoked. I\\'d like to give him a 30 second opportunity.\\n\\n Ms. Fiorina, I want to give you\\n\\n Governor Kasich, I\\'m coming to you next, but Ms. Fiorina\\'s name was mentioned, and I have to give her the opportunity to respond if she wants it.\\n\\n Thank you.\\n\\n Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.\\n\\nGovernor Kasich, I want to come \\u2014 I\\'m coming to you. I\\'m coming to you. Let me ask the question. You can use the time however you want.\\n\\n Donald Trump says that the hedge fund guys are getting away with murder by paying a lower tax rate. He wants to raise the taxes of hedge fund managers, as does Governor Bush. Do you agree?\\n\\n Thank you, Governor.\\n\\n Thank you, Governor Kasich.\\n\\n Governor Huckabee, I want to bring you in on the question of hedge fund managers and taxing them. You have said that you are bothered by the fact that hedge fund managers pay such a low tax rate and make 2,500 times what people who work for them make.\\n\\nDo you agree with what Donald Trump and Governor Bush have proposed, raising their tax rates?\\n\\n Thank you, Governor.\\n\\nDr. Carson, you support scrapping the entire tax code and replacing it with a flat tax based on the principal on tithing from the Bible. If you make $10 billion, you pay $1 billion in taxes, if you make $10, you pay $1 in taxes.\\n\\nDonald Trump believes in progressive taxation. He says it\\'s not right that rich people pay the same as the poor. Tell Donald Trump why his ideas on taxes are wrong.\\n\\n Mr. Trump...\\n\\n ...What do you think of the flat tax? Do you think it\\'s fair?\\n\\n Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Paul?\\n\\n Governor Walker, I want to go to you. Dr. Carson wants to raise the Federal Minimum Wage, you have called it a lame idea. Why is raising the Federal Minimum Wage lame?\\n\\n ...Thank you, Governor...\\n\\n ...Thank you, Governor...\\n\\n Dr. Carson, Governor Walker didn\\'t really answer the question, but I\\'ll let you respond. He called raising the Federal Minimum Wage lame, what do you think of that?\\n\\n Thank you, Dr. Carson...\\n\\n Let me bring in our partner from Salem Radio Network, Hugh Hewitt.\\n\\n Welcome back to CNN\\'s Republican Presidential Debate. Let\\'s turn to some issues now in foreign policy.\\n\\nMr. Trump, Senator Rubio said it was, quote, \"very concerning to him\" that in a recent interview you didn\\'t seem to know the details about some of the enemies the U.S. faces. Rubio said, if you don\\'t know the answers to those questions, you will not be able to serve as commander-in-chief.\\n\\nPlease respond to Senator Rubio.\\n\\n Senator Rubio?\\n\\n Mr. Trump? Senator Rubio seemed to be suggesting that you don\\'t know information that...\\n\\n All right. Senator Rubio.\\n\\n But are you saying that you have the knowledge to be the president that Mr. Trump does not have?\\n\\n Mr. Trump?\\n\\n Senator Rubio, he did invoke your absentee record in the Senate.\\n\\n Thank you, Senator Rubio. I want to turn now to Hugh Hewitt.\\n\\n Thank you, Governor.\\n\\n Senator...\\n\\n Senator Paul?\\n\\n Senator Paul...\\n\\n Thank you, Senator Paul...\\n\\n Thank you, Senator Paul...[crosstalk]\\n\\n Thank you, Governor.\\n\\n Thank you, Governor.\\n\\nSenator Rubio?\\n\\n Thank you, Senator.\\n\\n Dr. Carson?\\n\\n Thank you, Dr. Carson.\\n\\n I mean, it is interesting that you say that, because I want to ask Governor Christie about something else that you have said.\\n\\nGovernor Christie, we just marked the 14th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Now Dr. Carson has said that if he had been president at the time, the United States would not have gone to war in Afghanistan. What does that say to you about how Dr. Carson would respond as president if America were attacked again?\\n\\n Dr. Carson?\\n\\n ... Governor Christie.\\n\\n Dr. Carson?\\n\\n Thank you, Dr. Carson.\\n\\n Thank you, Dr. Carson.\\n\\n Thank you, Senator.\\n\\nGovernor Huckabee. [applause]\\n\\n Thank you, Governor.\\n\\n Thank you, governor, I want to turn to ISIS. Governor Walker...[crosstalk]\\n\\n Governor Walker, there is a big debate now, we have been talking about ISIS here and there in this discussion, there a big debate right now about whether or not to send more U.S. troops to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\\n\\nIn the first debate earlier this evening, Senator Lindsey Graham argued that candidates are only serious about fighting ISIS if they\\'re willing to send 10,000 U.S. troops to Iraq, 10,000 U.S. troops as part of a coalition to Syria.\\n\\nGovernor Walker, you say, you just told me a few days ago that the 3,000 U.S. troops there right now are enough, as long as the rules of engagement are changed.\\n\\nWhat do you know that Senator Graham doesn\\'t know?\\n\\n Thank you, Governor.\\n\\nSenator Paul, I want to go to you, because you have said that the boots on the ground to fight ISIS need to be Arab boots. We just learned today that despite the Obama administration spending $500 million to help create those Arab boots, there are only four or five U.S. trained fighters in Syria fighting ISIS.\\n\\nWhat does that say to you about the effectiveness of the idea of the boots on the ground need to be Arab boots?\\n\\n Thank you, Senator. [applause]\\n\\nWe\\'re going to turn to some domestic issues now. I want to bring in my colleague, Dana Bash.\\n\\n Sure....\\n\\n ...Thank you, Governor...\\n\\n ...Thank you, Governor. Dana Bash...\\n\\n Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina...\\n\\n ...Thank you, we\\'re going to turn now to domestic issues with Dana Bash.\\n\\n ...Dana Bash... [applause]\\n\\n Thank you. [applause]\\n\\nDana Bash?\\n\\n Thank you, Senator.\\n\\n ...Governor Bush...\\n\\n ...I want to let you respond.\\n\\n Thank you, Governor...\\n\\n...And, that\\'s what we should do, and I hope I\\'ll be working members of the United States Senate to fight hard for the passage of people that have that kind of qualification.\\n\\n Thank you, Senator.\\n\\n Thank you, Semator.\\n\\n Thank you, Senator. [applause]\\n\\nGovernor Huckabee, I want to bring you in very quickly if you could. Will you have a litmus test when it comes to appointing Supreme Court nominees?\\n\\n Thank you, Governor.\\n\\n Thank you, Governor.\\n\\n Thank you, Governor. We\\'re going to take a quick break. Coming up, one of the hottest questions that you have been asking us via social media. We will pose it to the candidates. That\\'s coming up right after this. [applause]\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\n I want to give that \\u2014 I want to give the person that you called a hypocrite an opportunity to respond. Do you want to identify that person?\\n\\n Is there somebody you were specifically thinking of?\\n\\n That\\'s what I though, but I wanted [inaudible] to say it.\\n\\n OK.\\n\\n Governor Bush, please.\\n\\n I want to go right now \\u2014 I want to go right now...\\n\\n That\\'s true. Go ahead, Christie, please.\\n\\n You may respond, and then I\\'ll bring in you, Ms. Fiorina. [applause]\\n\\n Yes, Senator Paul. [applause]\\n\\n I want to bring in Ms. Fiorina \\u2014 I want to bring in Ms. Fiorina on this issue.\\n\\n Hugh \\u2014 Hugh, I\\'d like to... [applause]\\n\\n I\\'d like to turn it over \\u2014 I\\'d like to turn to Dana Bush.\\n\\n Thank you, Governor.\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n We received a lot of questions from social media about climate change.\\n\\nSenator Rubio, Ronald Reagan\\'s secretary of state, George Shultz, reminds us that when Reagan was president he faced a similar situation to the one that we\\'re facing now. There were dire warnings from the mass consensus of the scientific community about the ozone layer shrinking.\\n\\nShultz says Ronald Reagan urged skeptics in industry to come up with a plan. He said, do it as an insurance policy in case the scientists are right. The scientists were right. Reagan and his approach worked.\\n\\nSecretary Shultz asks, why not take out an insurance policy and approach climate change the Reagan way?\\n\\n I\\'m citing George Shultz.\\n\\n Governor Christie, you have said that climate change is real, and that humans help contribute to it. Without getting into the issue of China versus the United States, which I understand you\\'ve talked about before, what do you make of skeptics of climate change such as Senator Rubio?\\n\\n Just for the record, I was citing Secretary of State George Shultz, Ronald Reagan\\'s secretary of state who I don\\'t think anybody would call him left-wing.\\n\\n I called you a skeptic.\\n\\n I want to go another question right now.\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n Thank you, Governor.\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n ...I\\'m turning to another \\u2014 I\\'m turning to another issue right now. Senator Cruz. Well, I think we\\'ve heard from several this evening.\\n\\nA backlash against vaccines was blamed for a measles outbreak here in California. Dr. Carson, Donald Trump has publicly and repeatedly linked vaccines, childhood vaccines, to autism, which, as you know, the medical community adamantly disputes.\\n\\nYou\\'re a pediatric neurosurgeon. Should Mr. Trump stop saying this?\\n\\n Should he stop saying it? Should he stop saying that vaccines cause autism?\\n\\n Mr. Trump, as president, you would...\\n\\n I\\'m going right to you.\\n\\n Mr. Trump, as president, you would be in charge of the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health, both of which say you are wrong. How would you handle this as president?\\n\\n Thank you.\\n\\n Dr. \\u2014 Dr. Carson?\\n\\n Dr. Carson, you just heard his medical take. [laughter]\\n\\n Dr. Paul? Dr. Paul, I\\'d like to bring you in.\\n\\n Alright, thank you so much...\\n\\n Coming up \\u2014 I\\'m sorry, Governor Huckabee, please.\\n\\n Thank you, Governor.\\n\\n We have to take another quick break. Coming up, Ronald Reagan looming large over this debate. So how Reaganesque exactly are these Republicans? We will find out next. [applause]\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\n Governor Huckabee?\\n\\n Senator Paul (sic).\\n\\n I\\'m sorry. Senator Rubio?\\n\\n Just the senators.\\n\\n Senator Cruz?\\n\\n Dr. Carson?\\n\\n Mr. Trump.\\n\\n Governor Bush.\\n\\n Governor Walker.\\n\\n Mrs. Fiorina.\\n\\n Governor Kasich.\\n\\n Governor Christie.\\n\\n Alright. Some good entries if anybody at the mint was listening. Here\\'s the next lighthearted question, you all know that the United States Secret Service uses codenames for the president, and his family. Ronald Reagan\\'s codename, for example, was, \"Rawhide\", an homage to his performances in Westerns. Nancy Reagan\\'s was, \"Rainbow\".\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to come up the one for your spouse, but, what would you want, Governor Christie, I\\'ll start with you, your Secret Service codename to be. [laughter]\\n\\n Governor Walker?\\n\\n Mr. Trump?\\n\\n Dr. Carson?\\n\\n Senator Cruz?\\n\\n Senator Rubio?\\n\\n Governor Huckabee.\\n\\n Senator Paul.\\n\\n That\\'s a mouthful, but OK. [laughter]\\n\\nOK, here\\'s the more serious question, Ronald Reagan, the 40th President, used the plane behind you to accomplish a great many things. Perhaps, most notably, to challenge Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the wall, and ultimately, to make peace with the USSR.\\n\\nHow will the world look different once your Air Force One is parked in the hangar of your presidential library?\\n\\nSenator Paul?\\n\\n That concludes this Republican presidential debate. On behalf of everyone here at CNN, we want to thank the candidates, the Reagan Library, and the Republican National Committee. Thank you, also, to Hugh Hewitt and Dana Bash.\\n\\nThe next presidential debate will also be right here on CNN, among the Democratic candidates, who will face off for the first time on October the 13th. That debate, a partnership with Facebook, will be moderated by my colleague, Anderson Cooper.\\n\\nAnd Anderson picks up our coverage of tonight\\'s debate right now. Before I throw to Anderson, let\\'s have one final round of applause for the candidates.', ...],\n",
       " u'TRUMP': [u' I fully understand.\\n\\n I fully understand.\\n\\n I cannot say. I have to respect the person that, if it\\'s not me, the person that wins, if I do win, and I\\'m leading by quite a bit, that\\'s what I want to do. I can totally make that pledge. If I\\'m the nominee, I will pledge I will not run as an independent. But -- and I am discussing it with everybody, but I\\'m, you know, talking about a lot of leverage. We want to win, and we will win. But I want to win as the Republican. I want to run as the Republican nominee.\\n\\n Well, I\\'ve given him plenty of money.\\n\\n I will not make the pledge at this time.\\n\\n Only Rosie O\\'Donnell. [laughter]\\n\\n Thank you.\\n\\n Yes, I\\'m sure it was.\\n\\n I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct. [applause]\\n\\nI\\'ve been challenged by so many people, and I don\\'t frankly have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn\\'t have time either. This country is in big trouble. We don\\'t win anymore. We lose to China. We lose to Mexico both in trade and at the border. We lose to everybody.\\n\\nAnd frankly, what I say, and oftentimes it\\'s fun, it\\'s kidding. We have a good time. What I say is what I say. And honestly Megyn, if you don\\'t like it, I\\'m sorry. I\\'ve been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me. But I wouldn\\'t do that. [applause]\\n\\nBut you know what, we -- we need strength, we need energy, we need quickness and we need brain in this country to turn it around. That, I can tell you right now.\\n\\n So, if it weren\\'t for me, you wouldn\\'t even be talking about illegal immigration, Chris. You wouldn\\'t even be talking about it. [applause] This was not a subject that was on anybody\\'s mind until I brought it up at my announcement. And I said, Mexico is sending. Except the reporters, because they\\'re a very dishonest lot, generally speaking, in the world of politics, they didn\\'t cover my statement the way I said it.\\n\\nThe fact is, since then, many killings ,murders, crime, drugs pouring across the border, are money going out and the drugs coming in. And I said we need to build a wall, and it has to be built quickly.\\n\\nAnd I don\\'t mind having a big beautiful door in that wall so that people can come into this country legally. But we need, Jeb, to build a wall, we need to keep illegals out. [cheering and applause]\\n\\n Border Patrol, I was at the border last week. Border Patrol, people that I deal with, that I talk to, they say this is what\\'s happening. Because our leaders are stupid. Our politicians are stupid.\\n\\nAnd the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don\\'t want to pay for them. They don\\'t want to take care of them.\\n\\nWhy should they when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them? And that\\'s what is happening whether you like it or not. [cheering and applause]\\n\\n A complete disaster, yes.\\n\\n Correct.\\n\\n First of all, I\\'d like to just go back to one. In July of 2004, I came out strongly against the war with Iraq, because it was going to destabilize the Middle East. And I\\'m the only one on this stage that knew that and had the vision to say it. And that\\'s exactly what happened.\\n\\n And the Middle East became totally destabilized. So I just want to say.\\n\\nAs far as single payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you\\'re talking about here.\\n\\nWhat I\\'d like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state. I have a big company with thousands and thousands of employees. And if I\\'m negotiating in New York or in New Jersey or in California, I have like one bidder. Nobody can bid.\\n\\nYou know why?\\n\\nBecause the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians, of course, with the exception of the politicians on this stage.\\n\\nBut they have total control of the politicians. They\\'re making a fortune.\\n\\nGet rid of the artificial lines and you will have...[timer sounds]...yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the people that can\\'t take care of themselves. And I will do that through a different system.\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n I\\'m not -- I\\'m not are -- I don\\'t think you heard me. You\\'re having a hard time tonight.\\n\\n You\\'d better believe it.\\n\\n If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I\\'ve given to, just so you understand, a lot of money.\\n\\n Many of them.\\n\\n Not much.\\n\\n But I...[crosstalk]\\n\\n I have good...\\n\\n Good.\\n\\n Sounds good. Sounds good to me, Governor.\\n\\nI will tell you that our system is broken. I gave to many people, before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give.\\n\\nAnd do you know what?\\n\\nWhen I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me.\\n\\n And that\\'s a broken system.\\n\\n Well, I\\'ll tell you what, with Hillary Clinton, I said be at my wedding and she came to my wedding.\\n\\nYou know why?\\n\\nShe didn\\'t have a choice because I gave. I gave to a foundation that, frankly, that foundation is supposed to do good. I didn\\'t know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world. It was.\\n\\nBut...[timer sounds] [crosstalk]\\n\\n Because I have used the laws of this country just like the greatest people that you read about every day in business have used the laws of this country, the chapter laws, to do a great job for my company, for myself, for my employees, for my family, et cetera.\\n\\nI have never gone bankrupt, by the way. I have never.\\n\\nBut out of hundreds of deals...\\n\\n Excuse me. Excuse me.\\n\\n Excuse me, what am I saying? Out of hundreds of deals that I\\'ve done, hundreds, on four occasions I\\'ve taken advantage of the laws of this country, like other people. I\\'m not going to name their names because I\\'m not going to embarrass, but virtually every person that you read about on the front page of the business sections, they\\'ve used the law.\\n\\nThe difference is, when somebody else uses those laws, nobody writes about it. When I use it, they say, \"Trump, Trump, Trump.\" The fact is, I built a net worth of more than $10 billion. I have a great, great company. I employ thousands of people. And I\\'m very proud of the job I did.\\n\\nAgain Chris, hundreds and hundreds of deals. Four times, I\\'ve taken advantage of the laws. And frankly, so has everybody else in my position.\\n\\n Well, I...\\n\\n Let me just tell you about the lenders. First of all, these lenders aren\\'t babies. These are total killers. These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think, OK? [laughter and applause] You know, I mean you\\'re living in a world of the make-believe, Chris, you want to know the truth. [applause] And I had the good sense to leave Atlantic City, which by the way, Caesars just went bankrupt. Every company, Chris can tell you, every company virtually in Atlantic City went bankrupt. [laughter] Every company.\\n\\nAnd let me just tell you. I had the good sense, and I\\'ve gotten a lot of credit in the financial pages, seven years ago I left Atlantic City before it totally cratered, and I made a lot of money in Atlantic City, and I\\'m very proud of it. I want to tell you that. Very, very proud of it.\\n\\n And by the way, this country right now owes $19 trillion. And they need somebody like me to straighten out that mess.[applause]\\n\\n I don\\'t think they like me very much. I\\'ll tell you what. I\\'ve evolved on many issues over the years. And you know who else has? Is Ronald Reagan evolved on many issues.\\n\\nAnd I am pro-life. And if you look at the question, I was in business. They asked me a question as to pro-life or choice. And I said if you let it run, that I hate the concept of abortion. I hate the concept of abortion. And then since then, I\\'ve very much evolved.\\n\\nAnd what happened is friends of mine years ago were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted. And it wasn\\'t aborted. And that child today is a total superstar, a great, great child. And I saw that. And I saw other instances.\\n\\nAnd I am very, very proud to say that I am pro-life.\\n\\nAs far as being a Republican is concerned, I come from a place, New York City, which is virtually, I mean, it is almost exclusively Democrat. And I have really started to see some of the negatives -- as an example, and I have a lot of liking for this man, but the last number of months of [timer sounds] his brother\\'s administration were a catastrophe. And unfortunately, those few months gave us President Obama. And you can\\'t be happy about that. [applause]\\n\\n First of all, Jeb, I am very happy that you denied that, and I appreciate that very much. He is a true gentleman. He really is.\\n\\nOne thing he did say, and I mean that. The one thing he did say about me, however, was my tone. And I also understand that. But when you have people that are cutting Christians\\' heads off, when you have a world that the border and at so many places, that it is medieval times, we\\'ve never -- it almost has to be as bad as it ever was in terms of the violence and the horror, we don\\'t have time for tone. [timer sounds] We have to go out and get the job done. [applause]\\n\\n I would be so different from what you have right now. Like, the polar opposite. We have a president who doesn\\'t have a clue. I would say he\\'s incompetent, but I don\\'t want to do that because that\\'s not nice. [laughter]\\n\\nBut if you look at the deals we make, whether it\\'s the nuclear deal with 24 hour periods -- and by the way, before you get to the 24 hours, you have to go through a system. You look at Sgt. Bergdahl, we get Bergdahl, a traitor, and they get five of the big, great killers leaders that they want. We have people in Washington that don\\'t know what they\\'re doing. Now... [applause; scream from audience]\\n\\nI agree. [applause]\\n\\nNow, with Iran, we\\'re making a deal, you would say, we want him. We want out our prisoners. We want all these things, and we don\\'t get anything. We\\'re giving them $150 billion dollars plus, they are going to be -- I\\'ll tell you what, if Iran was a stock, you folks should go out and buy it right now because you\\'ll quadruple -- this, what\\'s happening [timer sounds] in Iran, is a disgrace, and it\\'s going to lead to destruction in large portions of the world. [applause]\\n\\n Our country is in serious trouble. We don\\'t win anymore.\\n\\nWe don\\'t beat China in trade. We don\\'t beat Japan, with their millions and millions of cars coming into this country, in trade. We can\\'t beat Mexico, at the border or in trade.\\n\\nWe can\\'t do anything right. Our military has to be strengthened. Our vets have to be taken care of. We have to end Obamacare, and we have to make our country great again, and I will do that.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\n', u' I\\'m Donald Trump. I wrote \"The Art of the Deal\". I say not in a braggadocious way, I\\'ve made billions and billions of dollars dealing with people all over the world, and I want to put whatever that talent is to work for this country so we have great trade deals, we make our country rich again, we make it great again. We build our military, we take care of our vets, we get rid of Obamacare, and we have a great life altogether.\\n\\nThank you. Thank you. [applause]\\n\\n Well, first of all, Rand Paul shouldn\\'t even be on this stage. He\\'s number 11, he\\'s got 1 percent in the polls, and how he got up here, there\\'s far too many people anyway.\\n\\nAs far as temperament \\u2014 and we all know that \\u2014 as far as temperament, I think I have a great temperament. I built a phenomenal business with incredible, iconic assets, one of the really truly great real-estate businesses.\\n\\nAnd I may be an entertainer, because I\\'ve had tremendous success with number-one bestsellers all over the place, with \"The Apprentice\" and everything else I\\'ve done.\\n\\nBut I will tell you this: What I am far and away greater than an entertainer is a businessman, and that\\'s the kind of mindset this country needs to bring it back, because we owe $19 trillion right now, $19 trillion, and you need this kind of thinking to bring our country back.\\n\\nAnd believe me, my temperament is very good, very calm. But we will be respected outside of this country. We are not respected now. [applause]\\n\\n I never attacked him on his look, and believe me, there\\'s plenty of subject matter right there. [laughter] That I can tell you.\\n\\n I\\'ve actually been in politics all my life, although I\\'ve been on that side as opposed to this side. I\\'m now a politician for about three months. Obviously, I\\'m doing pretty well. I\\'m number one in every poll by a lot.\\n\\nBut the qualification is that I\\'ve dealt with people all over the world, been successful all over the world. Everything I\\'ve done virtually has been a tremendous success.\\n\\nWhen markets changed, when things turned, I heard Governor Pataki, who, by the way, was a failed governor in New York, a very seriously failed \\u2014 he wouldn\\'t be elected dog catcher right now. I heard what he had to say.\\n\\nAnd I will tell you this: Atlantic City, I\\'ve made a tremendous amount of money in Atlantic City. I left seven years ago, I\\'ve gotten great credit for my timing, and that\\'s what I\\'m all about.\\n\\nI\\'m a businessman, did really well, really well, and Jeb, what I want to do is put that ability into this country to make our country rich again. And I can do that, and I\\'m not sure that anybody else in the group will be able to do that.\\n\\n But I have to say...\\n\\n Well, in Wisconsin...\\n\\n Excuse me.\\n\\n In Wisconsin, you\\'re losing $2.2 billion right now.\\n\\n I would do so much better than that.\\n\\n No.\\n\\n I\\'m using facts.\\n\\n Every major business leader has used the \\u2014 I never went bankrupt, by the way, as you know, everybody knows. But we \\u2014 hundreds of companies, hundreds of deals, I\\'ve used\\n\\n Every major business leader, has used the \\u2014 I never went bank bankrupt, by the way, as you know, everybody knows. But \\u2014 hundreds of companies, hundreds of deals, I used the law four times and made a tremendous thing. I\\'m in business. I did a very good job.\\n\\nBut I will say this, and people are very, very impressed with what I\\'ve done, the business people. But when the folks of Iowa found out the true facts of the job that you\\'ve done in Wisconsin, all of a sudden you, tubed (ph), he was No. 1 and now he\\'s No. 6 or seven in the polls.\\n\\nSo, look, we brought it out, you were supposed to make a billion dollars in the state. You lost 2.2 \\u2014 you have right now, a huge budget deficit. That\\'s not a Democratic point. That\\'s a point. That\\'s a fact. And when the people of Iowa found that out, I went to No. 1 and you went down the tubes.\\n\\n I didn\\'t \\u2014\\n\\n Totally false.\\n\\n I would have gotten it.\\n\\n I promise I would have gotten it.\\n\\n I promise if I wanted it, I would have gotten it.\\n\\n I know my people.\\n\\n I know my people.\\n\\n No. I just will tell you that, you know, Jeb made the statement. I\\'m not only referring to him. I \\u2014 a lot of money was raised by a lot of different people that are standing up here. And the donors, the special interests, the lobbyists have very strong power over these people.\\n\\nI\\'m spending all of my money, I\\'m not spending \\u2014 I\\'m not getting any \\u2014 I turned down \\u2014 I turn down so much, I could have right now from special interests and donors, I could have double and triple what he\\'s got. I\\'ve turned it down. I turned down last week $5 million from somebody.\\n\\nSo I will tell you I understand the game, I\\'ve been on the other side all of my life. And they have a lot of control over our politicians. And I don\\'t say that favorably, and I\\'m not sure if there\\'s another system, but I say this. I am not accepting any money from anybody. Nobody has control of me other than the people of this country. I\\'m going to do the right thing.\\n\\n That\\'s true. That\\'s true.\\n\\n I was \\u2014 excuse me, Jeb.\\n\\n I was a businessman, I got along with Clinton, I got along with everybody. That was my job, to get along with people.\\n\\n I didn\\'t want to \\u2014 excuse me. One second.\\n\\n OK, more energy tonight. I like that. [laughter]\\n\\nLook \\u2014\\n\\n I didn\\'t want \\u2014 it was my obligation as a businessman to my family, to my company, to my employees, to get along with all politicians. I get along with all of them, and I did a damn good job in doing it. Go ahead.\\n\\n Got along with everybody.\\n\\n Wrong.\\n\\n Don\\'t make things up. Jeb, don\\'t make things up. Come on.\\n\\n Don\\'t make things up.\\n\\n So, number one, they have to respect you. He has absolutely no respect for President Obama. Zero.\\n\\nSyria\\'s a mess. You look at what\\'s going on with ISIS in there, now think of this: we\\'re fighting ISIS. ISIS wants to fight Syria. Why are we fighting ISIS in Syria? Let them fight each other and pick up the remnants.\\n\\nI would talk to him. I would get along with him. I believe \\u2014 and I may be wrong, in which case I\\'d probably have to take a different path, but I would get along with a lot of the world leaders that this country is not getting along with.\\n\\nWe don\\'t get along with China. We don\\'t get along with the heads of Mexico. We don\\'t get along with anybody, and yet, at the same time, they rip us left and right. They take advantage of us economically and every other way. We get along with nobody.\\n\\nI will get along \\u2014 I think \\u2014 with Putin, and I will get along with others, and we will have a much more stable \\u2014 stable world.\\n\\n I believe that I will get along \\u2014 we will do \\u2014 between that, Ukraine, all of the other problems, we won\\'t have the kind of problems that our country has right now with Russia and many other nations.\\n\\n I wouldn\\'t have drawn the line, but once he drew it, he had no choice but to go across. They do bear some responsibility, but I think he probably didn\\'t do it, not for that reason.\\n\\nSomehow, he just doesn\\'t have courage. There is something missing from our president. Had he crossed the line and really gone in with force, done something to Assad \\u2014 if he had gone in with tremendous force, you wouldn\\'t have millions of people displaced all over the world.\\n\\n They had a responsibility, absolutely. I think we have three of them here...\\n\\n I think they had a responsibility, yes.\\n\\n Jeb, just...\\n\\n I think it will haunt him. I think it\\'s a terrible. I think it\\'s going to haunt him absolutely. He came back later and he said he misspoke. There was no question because I heard when he said the statement. I was watching and he said the statement.\\n\\nAnd I said, wow, I can\\'t believe it. I will take care of women. I respect women. I will take care of women.\\n\\nOne thing we will say and I would like to get back to the Iran situation. We\\'re talking about Iran. The agreement was terrible. It was incompetent. I\\'ve never seen anything like it. One of the worst contracts of any kind I\\'ve ever seen.\\n\\nAnd nobody ever mentions North Korea where you have this maniac sitting there and he actually has nuclear weapons and somebody better start thinking about North Korea and perhaps a couple of other places. But certainly North Korea.\\n\\nAnd Ted and I have spoken. We\\'ve \\u2014 a lot of us have spoken. We\\'re talking about Iran. They are bad actors, bad things are going to happen. But in the meantime, you have somebody right now in North Korea who has got nuclear weapons and who is saying almost every other week, I\\'m ready to use them. And we don\\'t even mention it.\\n\\n So why didn\\'t you say it? Why didn\\'t you say it?\\n\\n I know, but why did you say it? I heard it myself. Why did you say it?\\n\\n You said you\\'re going to cut funding for women\\'s health. You said it.\\n\\n You said it.\\n\\n I think she\\'s got a beautiful face, and I think she\\'s a beautiful woman.\\n\\n Correct. First of all, I want to build a wall, a wall that works. So important, and it\\'s a big part of it.\\n\\nSecond of all, we have a lot of really bad dudes in this country from outside, and I think Chris knows that, maybe as well as anybody.\\n\\nThey go, if I get elected, first day they\\'re gone. Gangs all over the place. Chicago, Baltimore, no matter where you look.\\n\\nWe have a country based on laws. I will make sure that those laws are adhered to. These are illegal immigrants. I don\\'t think you\\'d even be asking this question if I didn\\'t run because when I ran, and I brought this up, my opening remarks at Trump Tower, I took heat like nobody has taken heat in a long time. And, then they found out with the killing of Katie, from San Francisco, and so many other crimes, they found out that I was right.\\n\\nAnd, most people, many people, apologized to me. I don\\'t think you\\'d even be talking about illegal immigration if it weren\\'t for me. So, we have a country of laws, they\\'re going to go out, and they\\'ll come back if they deserve to come back. If they\\'ve had a bad record, if they\\'ve been arrested, if they\\'ve been in jail, they\\'re never coming back. We\\'re going to have a country again. Right now, we don\\'t have a country, we don\\'t have a border, and we\\'re going to do something about it, and it can be done with proper management, and it can be done with heart.\\n\\n ...By the way, I agree with \\u2014 with what Chris is saying, but, I will say this. Illegal immigration is costing us more than $200 billion dollars a year just to maintain what we have.\\n\\n Correct.\\n\\n Well, I have to tell you, I hear phenomenal things. I hear your wife is a lovely woman...\\n\\n I don\\'t know her, and this is a total mischaracterization...\\n\\n Good.\\n\\n No, I won\\'t do that, because I\\'ve said nothing wrong.\\n\\n But I do hear she\\'s a lovely woman.\\n\\n Jeb said...\\n\\n ... that they come into our country as an act of love.\\n\\nWith all of the problems we that we have, in so many instances \\u2014 we have wonderful people coming in. But with all of the problems \\u2014 this is not an act of love. He\\'s weak on immigration \\u2014 by the way, in favor of Common Core, which is also a disaster, but weak on immigration.\\n\\nHe doesn\\'t get my vote.\\n\\n Not with this intensity.\\n\\n As I said, we are spending $200 billion \\u2014 we are spending $200 billion a year on maintaining what we have. We will move them out. The great ones will come back, the good ones will come back.\\n\\nThey\\'ll be expedited, they\\'ll be back, they\\'ll come back legally. We\\'ll have a country \\u2014 they\\'ll come back, legally.\\n\\n Well, I think it\\'s wonderful and all, but I did it a little bit half-heartedly, but I do mean it to a large extent.\\n\\nWe have a country, where, to assimilate, you have to speak English. And I think that where he was, and the way it came out didn\\'t sound right to me. We have to have assimilation \\u2014 to have a country, we have to have assimilation.\\n\\nI\\'m not the first one to say this, Dana. We\\'ve had many people over the years, for many, many years, saying the same thing. This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish. [applause]\\n\\n This is a reporter, not a high school kid.\\n\\n Well, first of all, the \\u2014 the 14th Amendment says very, very clearly to a lot of great legal scholars \\u2014 not television scholars, but legal scholars \\u2014 that it is wrong. It can be corrected with an act of Congress, probably doesn\\'t even need that.\\n\\nA woman gets pregnant. She\\'s nine months, she walks across the border, she has the baby in the United States, and we take care of the baby for 85 years. I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nAnd by the way, Mexico and almost every other country anywhere in the world doesn\\'t have that. We\\'re the only ones dumb enough, stupid enough to have it. And people \\u2014 and by the way, this is not just with respect to Mexico. They are coming from Asia to have babies here, and all of a sudden, we have to take care of the babies for the life of the baby.\\n\\nThe 14th Amendment, it reads properly, you can go and \\u2014 it\\'s probably going to be have to be check \\u2014 go through a process of court, probably ends up at the Supreme Court, but there are a lot of great legal scholars that say that is not correct.\\n\\nAnd in my opinion, it makes absolutely no \\u2014 we\\'re the only \\u2014 one of the only countries, we\\'re going to take care of those babies for 70, 75, 80, 90 years? I don\\'t think so.\\n\\n I agree 100 percent, by the way, with Carly on the fact that the Democrats do not want to solve this problem, for the obvious reasons, but they do not.\\n\\nBut I believe that a reading of the 14th Amendment allows you to have an interpretation where this is not legal and where it can\\'t be done. I\\'ve seen both sides, but some of the greatest scholars agree with me, without having to go through Congress.\\n\\nIf you do go through Congress, you can absolutely solve the problem.\\n\\n That\\'s true, sure.\\n\\n Well \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 let me \\u2014 well, let me just explain. The head of the Yale Business School, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, wrote a paper recently, one of the worst tenures for a CEO that he has ever seen, ranked one of the top 20 in the history of business. The company is a disaster and continues to be a disaster. They still haven\\'t recovered. In fact, today, on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, they fired another 25 or 30,000 people saying we still haven\\'t recovered from the catastrophe.\\n\\nWhen Carly says the revenues went up, that\\'s because she bought Compaq, it was a terrible deal, and it really led to the destruction of the company.\\n\\nNow one other company before that was Lucent. Carly was at Lucent before that. And Lucent turned out to be a catastrophe also. So I only say this. She can\\'t run any of my companies. That I can tell you.\\n\\n I never filed for bankruptcy.\\n\\n I\\'ll tell you why; it\\'s very simple.\\n\\n I\\'ll tell you. I was running \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 Carly, Carly \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 I\\'ve made over $10 billion. I had a casino company \\u2014 Caesars just filed for bankruptcy. Chris will tell you \\u2014 it\\'s not Chris\\' fault either \\u2014 but almost everybody in Atlantic City is either in trouble or filed for \\u2014 maybe I\\'ll blame Chris.\\n\\n But Atlantic City is a disaster \\u2014\\n\\n Wait a minute, Carly. Wait. I let you speak. Atlantic City is a disaster, and I did great in Atlantic City. I knew when to get out. My timing was great. And I got a lot of credit for it.\\n\\nMany of the great business people that you know \\u2014 and Carl Icon (ph) is going to work with me on making great deals for this country. But whether it\\'s Carl or so many others that we read about all the time \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 they have used the laws of the land, which is the \\u2014\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n ...Well, I\\'d like to respond, I\\'d like to respond...\\n\\n Well, I think the thing about the flat tax, I know it very well. What I don\\'t like is that if you make $200 million a year, you pay ten percent, you\\'re paying very little relatively to somebody that\\'s making $50,000 a year, and has to hire H&R Block to do the \\u2014 because it\\'s so complicated.\\n\\nOne thing I\\'ll say to Ben is that we\\'ve had a graduated tax system for many years, so it\\'s not a socialistic thing. What I\\'d like to do, and I\\'ll be putting in the plan in about two weeks, and I think people are going to like it, it\\'s a major reduction in taxes. It\\'s a major reduction for the middle class. The hedge fund guys won\\'t like me as much as they like me right now. I know them all, but they\\'ll pay more.\\n\\nI know people that are making a tremendous amount of money and paying virtually no tax, and I think it\\'s unfair.\\n\\n Well, I heard Hugh Hewitt, a nice man, he apologized because he actually said that we had a misunderstanding. And he said today that Donald Trump is maybe the best interview there is anywhere that he has ever done.\\n\\nNow unless he was just saying that on CNN to be nice, but he did say that...\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n And we had a legitimate misunderstanding in terms of his pronunciation of a word.\\n\\nBut I would say just... [laughter]\\n\\n OK. So I will say this, though, Hugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere that would have known those names. I think he was reading them off a sheet.\\n\\nAnd frankly I will have \\u2014 and I told him, I will have the finest team that anybody has put together and we will solve a lot of problems.\\n\\nYou know, right now they know a lot and look at what is happening. The world is blowing up around us. We will have great teams and great people.\\n\\n I hope that answers your question. I mean, you are in the Senate, but I hope that answers your question.\\n\\n No, I don\\'t think he\\'s suggesting that at all. I mean...\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n I don\\'t think he\\'s suggesting that at all.\\n\\n Well, you have to understand, I am not sitting in the United States Senate with, by the way, the worst voting record there is today. Number one. I am not sitting in the United States Senate. I\\'m a businessman doing business transactions.\\n\\n I am doing business transactions. I will know more about this \\u2014 and, as you said, that was very acceptable, and when you listen to that whole interview, it\\'s a great interview, you said it, I didn\\'t. Well, now I did. But...[crosstalk]\\n\\n I will know...\\n\\n ...I will know more about the problems of this world by the time I sit, and you look at what\\'s going in this world right now by people that supposedly know, this world is a mess.\\n\\n [inaudible]\\n\\n [inaudible] I\\'m \\u2014 and I\\'m meeting with people that are terrific people, but I have to say something because it\\'s about judgment.\\n\\nI am the only person on this dais \\u2014 the only person \\u2014 that fought very, very hard against us (ph), and I wasn\\'t a sitting politician going into Iraq, because I said going into Iraq \\u2014 that was in 2003, you can check it out, check out \\u2014 I\\'ll give you 25 different stories.\\n\\nIn fact, a delegation was sent to my office to see me because I was so vocal about it. I\\'m a very militaristic person, but you have to know when to use the military. I\\'m the only person up here that fought against going into Iraq.\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n Just excuse me, one second, Rand...\\n\\n If you don\\'t mind, Rand \\u2014 you know, you are on last \\u2014 you do have your 1 percent.\\n\\nI would like \\u2014 and I think it\\'s very important. I think it\\'s important, because it\\'s about judgment. It\\'s about judgment.\\n\\nI didn\\'t want to go into Iraq, and I fought it, because what I said \\u2014 what I said...\\n\\n ... was you\\'re going to \\u2014 you\\'re going to destabilize...\\n\\n ... the Middle East, and that\\'s what happened.\\n\\n If you think about it...\\n\\n Your brother \\u2014 and your brother\\'s administration gave us Barack Obama, because it was such a disaster, those last three months, that Abraham Lincoln couldn\\'t have been elected.\\n\\n I don\\'t know. You feel safe right now? I don\\'t feel so safe.\\n\\n Or the collapse of the economy.\\n\\n Speaking for myself, I\\'m OK with it. I think there\\'s a certain truth to it. I know people that, frankly, it has no impact on their life whatsoever. There are many people.\\n\\nI would almost say leave it up to them, but I would be willing to check it off, and say I will not get Social Security. I do not...\\n\\n As a policy, I would almost leave it up to the people. Don\\'t forget they pay in and they pay in, and maybe they do well, and maybe some people want it. But the fact is that there are people that truly don\\'t need it, and there are many people that do need it very, very badly. And I would be willing to write mine off 100 percent, Dana.\\n\\n Well, I \\u2014 I \\u2014 I\\'d like to respond.\\n\\n I\\'d like to respond.\\n\\n Autism has become an epidemic. Twenty-five years ago, 35 years ago, you look at the statistics, not even close. It has gotten totally out of control.\\n\\nI am totally in favor of vaccines. But I want smaller doses over a longer period of time. Because you take a baby in \\u2014 and I\\'ve seen it \\u2014 and I\\'ve seen it, and I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time.\\n\\nSame exact amount, but you take this little beautiful baby, and you pump \\u2014 I mean, it looks just like it\\'s meant for a horse, not for a child, and we\\'ve had so many instances, people that work for me.\\n\\nJust the other day, two years old, two and a half years old, a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.\\n\\nI only say it\\'s not \\u2014 I\\'m in favor of vaccines, do them over a longer period of time, same amount.\\n\\n But just in \\u2014 in little sections.\\n\\n I think \\u2014 and I think you\\'re going to have \\u2014 I think you\\'re going to see a big impact on autism.\\n\\n And that\\'s all I\\'m saying, Jake. That\\'s all I\\'m saying.\\n\\n Well, because she\\'s been sitting for three hours, I think my daughter, Ivanka, who\\'s right here. [applause]\\n\\n Humble. [laughter and applause]\\n\\n If I become president, we will do something really special. We will make this country greater than ever before. We\\'ll have more jobs. We\\'ll have more of everything.\\n\\nWe were discussing disease, we were discussing all sorts of things tonight, many of which will just be words, it will just pass on. I don\\'t want to say politicians, all talk, no action. But a lot of what we talked about is words and it will be forgotten very quickly.\\n\\nIf I\\'m president, many of the things that we discussed tonight will not be forgotten. We\\'ll find solutions. And the world will respect us. They will respect us like never before. And it will be actually a friendlier world.\\n\\nAnd I have to say, it is a great honor to be here tonight.

That\\'s been consistently proven.\\n\\nUnlike Hillary Clinton, who has a radical position in terms of support for Planned Parenthood, I defunded Planned Parenthood more than four years ago, long before any of these videos came out... [applause] ...I\\'ve got a position that\\'s in line with everyday America. [applause]\\n\\n Chris, I actually said that on your show earlier this year. [crosstalk] I acknowledged that. I said I actually listened to the American people. And I think people across America want a leader who\\'s actually going to listen to them.\\n\\nI talked to border state governors and other elected officials. I look at how this president, particularly through last November, messed up the immigration system in this country. Most importantly, I listened to the people of America.\\n\\nI believe we need to secure the border. I\\'ve been to the border with Governor Abbott in Texas and others, seeing the problems that they have there. There is international criminal organizations penetrating our southern based borders, and we need to do something about it. Secure the border, enforce the law, no amnesty, and go forward with the legal immigration system that gives priority to American working families and wages. [applause]\\n\\n I don\\'t know about additional ones. We need to focus on the ones we have. You look at Egypt, probably the best relationship we\\'ve had in Israel, at least in my lifetime, incredibly important.\\n\\nYou look at the Saudis -- in fact, earlier this year, I met with Saudi leaders, and leaders from the United Arab Emirates, and I asked them what\\'s the greatest challenge in the world today? Set aside the Iran deal. They said it\\'s the disengagement of America. We are leading from behind under the Obama-Clinton doctrine -- America\\'s a great country. We need to stand up and start leading again, and we need to have allies, not just in Israel, but throughout the Persian Gulf.\\n\\n Just one second on this, though.\\n\\nWe -- we spent a lot of time talking about Hillary Clinton and ---and pitting us back and forth.\\n\\nLet\\'s be clear, we should be talking about Hillary Clinton on that last subject, because everywhere in the world that Hillary Clinton touched is more messed up today than before she and the president [inaudible].\\n\\n It\\'s true.\\n\\n Well, the voters in Wisconsin elected me last year for the third time because they wanted someone who aimed high, not aimed low.\\n\\nBefore I came in, the unemployment rate was over eight percent. It\\'s now down to 4.6 percent. We\\'ve more than made up for the jobs that were lost during the recession. And the rate in which people are working is almost five points higher than it is nationally.\\n\\nYou know, people like Hillary Clinton think you grow the economy by growing Washington. One report last year showed that six of the top 10 wealthiest counties in America were in or around Washington, D.C.. I think most of us in America understand that people, not the government creates jobs. And one of the best things we can do is get the government out of the way, repeal Obamacare, put in -- reign in all the out of control regulations, put in place an all of the above energy policy, give people the education, the skills that the need to succeed, and lower the tax rate and reform the tax code. That\\'s what I\\'ll do as president, just like I did in Wisconsin. [applause]\\n\\n Well, first off, let\\'s remember. I still remember, as a kid, tying a yellow ribbon around a tree in front of my house during the 444 days that Iran held 52 Americans hostage. Iran is not a place we should be doing business with.\\n\\nTo me, you terminate the deal on day one, you reinstate the sanctions authorized by Congress, you go to Congress and put in place even more crippling sanctions in place, and then you convince our allies to do the same.\\n\\nThis is not just bad with Iran, this is bad with ISIS. It is tied together, and, once and for all, we need a leader who\\'s gonna stand up and do something about it.\\n\\nIt\\'s yet another example of the failed foreign policy of the Obama-Clinton doctrine. [applause]\\n\\n Well, I think the most important thing we can do when it comes to policing -- it\\'s something you\\'ve had a guest on who\\'s a friend of mine Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clark, who\\'s talked to me about this many times in the past -- it\\'s about training. It\\'s about making sure that law enforcement professionals, not only in the way in to their positions but all the way through their time, have the proper training, particularly when it comes to the use of force. And that we protect and stand up and support those men and women who are doing their jobs in law enforcement. And for the very few that don\\'t, that there are consequences to show that we treat everyone the same here in America.\\n\\n Well first off, for the cyber attack with Russia the other day, it\\'s sad to think right now, but probably the Russian and Chinese government know more about Hillary Clinton\\'s e-mail server than do the members of the United States Congress. [laughter and applause]\\n\\nAnd -- and that has put our national security at risk. If I am president, he won\\'t think about that. You know, Putin believes in the old Lenin adage: you probe with bayonets. When you find mush, you push. When you find steel, you stop.\\n\\nUnder Obama and Clinton, we found a lot of mush over the last two years. We need to have a national security that puts steel in front of our enemies. I would send weapons to Ukraine. I would work with NATO to put forces on the eastern border of Poland and the Baltic nations, and I would reinstate, put in place back in the missile defense system that we had in Poland and in the Czech Republic. [applause]\\n\\nWe find steel.\\n\\n Well, thanks, Megyn.\\n\\nI\\'m certainly an imperfect man. And it\\'s only by the blood of Jesus Christ that I\\'ve been redeemed from my sins. So I know that God doesn\\'t call me to do a specific thing, God hasn\\'t given me a list, a Ten Commandments, if you will, of things to act on the first day.\\n\\nWhat God calls us to do is follow his will. And ultimately that\\'s what I\\'m going to try to do. And I hope people\\'ve seen it in my state, even in the big challenges I took on when I had over 100,000 protesters in and around our capital, trying to do what I thought was the right thing.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t just how I took on those political battles. It was ultimately how I acted. Not responding in kind. Not lashing out. But just being decent going forward and living my life in a way that would be a testimony to him and our faith. [applause]\\n\\n Thanks.\\n\\nI\\'m guy with a wife and two kids, and Harley. One article called me \"aggressively normal.\"\\n\\nI ran for governor because I was worried about my kids\\' future. Then, I took on the big government union bosses, and we won. They tried to recall me, and we won. They target us again, and we won.\\n\\nWe balanced the budget, cut taxes, and turned our state around with big, bold reforms.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t too late for Wisconsin, and it\\'s not too late for America. That\\'s why I ask for your vote.\\n\\n', u\" Good evening, I'm Scott Walker, and tonight, I want to thank and Mrs. Reagan, and the Reagan Library for hosting us. You see, in my lifetime, the greatest president was a governor from California. Ronald Reagan knew how to go big, and go bold. He understood the essence of moving this country forward, and that's what I did when I took on the status quo in my state, and the Washington based special interest.\\n\\nNow, more than ever, America needs a leader who will go big and bold again. Someone who's been tested. I'm ready to be that leader. Thank you. [applause]\\n\\n But Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake...\\n\\n But Jake, this \\u2014 this is \\u2014 this...\\n\\n Jake, this is \\u2014 this is \\u2014 this is...\\n\\n This is actually what's wrong \\u2014 this is what's wrong with this debate. We're not talking about real issues.\\n\\nAnd Mr. Trump, we don't need an apprentice in the White House. [applause]\\n\\nWe don't need an apprentice in the White House. We have one right now. He told us all the things we wanted to hear back in 2008. We don't know who you are or where you're going. We need someone who can actually get the job done.\\n\\nAnd you talked about business.\\n\\n You \\u2014 you \\u2014 let me finish...\\n\\n No, no...\\n\\n You're using the talking...\\n\\n Mr. Trump, you're using the talking points of the Democrats...\\n\\n ... and as we all know...\\n\\n ... that failed three times in four and a half years when I got elected, because it is working. We balanced a budget.\\n\\nYou want to talk about balanced budgets? You took four major projects into bankruptcy over and over and over again. You can't take America into bankruptcy. That's what's wrong with the politicians in Washington right now. They think we can take a country into bankruptcy.\\n\\n[crosstalk]\\n\\n Jake, yeah, absolutely, I'll take this on, because this is an issue that's important in this race.\\n\\nJust because he says it doesn't make it true. The facts are the facts. [applause]\\n\\nWe balanced a $3.6 billion budget deficit, we did it by cutting taxes \\u2014 $4.7 billion to help working families, family farmers, small business owners and senior citizens. And it's about time people in America stand up and take note of this.\\n\\nIf you want someone that can actually take on the special interest of Washington, which you yourself said you were part of, using the system, we need somebody that will stand up and fight for average Americans to put them back in charge of their government.\\n\\nI'm the one who is taking that on. I'll do that as your next president.\\n\\n Two parts to that, one on China, one back for a second on Iran.\\n\\nWhen it comes to China, why would we be giving an official state visit to a country that's been involved in a massive cyber attack against the United States? That's not just a visit, that's a 21 gun salute on the South Lawn of the White House. It just doesn't make any sense. If we're ever going to send a message to them, wouldn't this be the time, when they've issued this, sort of, massive attack against us?\\n\\nAnd, Jake, for the question, I was one of the first ones to call for terminating the bad deal with Iran on day one. The President came after me and said I need to bone up. You know, the President who called ISIS the JV squad said I needed to bone up.\\n\\nThe reality is it's a bad deal on day one, and it's a bad deal because this president has allowed Iran to go closer, and closer.\\n\\nI'd love to play cards with this guy because Barack Obama folds on everything with Iran. We need a leader who's going to stand up, and actually [inaudible]...\\n\\n Jake, just one more moment. This is \\u2014 there's something bigger to this. Now, I \\u2014 like so many other governors here, I defunded Planned Parenthood four-and-a-half years ago, in a Blue State. But it's bigger than that. We did that in a Blue State, we took the money and put it into women's health, so we did exactly what we're talking about here.\\n\\nBut I think the bigger issue here is we should be able to do this nationally, and this is precisely why so many Republicans are upset with Washington. They see the House and they see the Senate and they say why can't we pass this. Why can't we defund Planned \\u2014 put it in a spending bill.\\n\\nForget about the 60-vote rule, there's no reason \\u2014 and the Constitution doesn't call for 60 votes. Pass it with 51 votes, put it on the desk of the president \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 and go forward and actually make a point. This is why \\u2014\\n\\n \\u2014 people are upset with Washington.\\n\\n So, the best way to help people see their wages go up is to get them the education, the skill they need, to take on careers that pay more than minimum wage. And, it's why we talk about it, it's all about jobs. You want to help actually get jobs, it's why on that last question we were trying to jump in on taxes. To me, it's not just about taxes, cutting taxes. I've done it as much as anyone has.\\n\\nI've cut income taxes, I've cut property taxes. In fact, property taxes are lower today in my state than they were before we took office. The real issues about jobs.\\n\\nRonald Reagan, our plan is based on the Ronald Reagan tax cuts of 1986. That brought about one of the longest sustained periods of economic growth in American history. All the things we should be talking about tonight are about how do we create jobs, helping people get the skills and the education qualifications they need to succeed.\\n\\nThat's the way you help people create jobs. It's part of our large plan to reform the tax code, to cut taxes, to put in place an education system that gives people the skills and education that they need. To put in place all the above energy policy, but you start on day one with repealing Obamacare.\\n\\nI'm the only one on this stage that's actually got a plan, introduced an actual plan to repeal Obamacare on day one. I'll send a bill up to Congress, and to make sure enact it...\\n\\n ...I'm going to sign an order that makes the Congress live by the same rules as everybody else.\\n\\n ...That will ensure they repeal Obamacare...\\n\\n ...Jake, Jake, Jake, I just want to address that issue because you said I didn't answer, and I did. I said, to me, I think the real focus shouldn't be \\u2014 you know, Hillary Clinton talks about the minimum wage. That's her answer to grow the economy. The answer is to give people the skills and the education so they make far more than minimum wage.\\n\\nI don't want to argue about how low things are going to be, I want to talk about how do we lift everyone up in America. That's what Reagan talked about. It wasn't how bad things were, it was how to make it better for everyone. That's what we've done in Wisconsin, that's exactly what we'd do as...\\n\\n That's because of Barack \\u2014 that's because of Barack Obama.\\n\\n That's because of Barack Obama. We've had a president who called ISIS the J.V. squad, Yemen a success story, Iran a place we can do business with. It's not because of George W. Bush; it's because of Barack Obama... [applause] [inaudible] on that point, though, whether it's \\u2014 whether we're talking about national security, foreign policy or we're talking about domestic policy, the key...\\n\\n ... the key issue here is talking about leadership. Now, there's a lot of greater people up here, and you've heard a lot of great ideas out there. But I would ask the American people, look at who's been tested.\\n\\nWhen there were 100,000 protesters in my capital, I didn't back down, when they issued death threats against me and threats against my family, I didn't back down, when they tried to recall me, I didn't back down, and when they made me the \\u2014 one of their number-one targets last year, I didn't back down.\\n\\nGive me the chance to be your president.\\n\\n I won't back down...\\n\\n ... on any of these issues.\\n\\n To be clear, what I said the other day was that we need to lift the political restrictions that are already in play. Barack Obama's administration has put political restrictions on the military personnel already in Iraq.\\n\\nWe need to lift those and then we need to listen to our military experts, not the political forces in the White House, but our military experts about how many more we sent in. And we certainly shouldn't have a commander-in-chief who sends a message to our adversaries as to how far we're going to go, and how far we're willing to fight, so I'm not putting a troop number.\\n\\nWhat I'm saying is lift the political restrictions. When you do that, you empower our military personnel already there to work with the Kurd and the Sunni allies, to reclaim the territory taken by ISIS. And to do so in a way that allows that ISIS doesn't go back in Syria, as we were just talking about here.\\n\\nThat is the fundamental problem going forward. We have a president \\u2014 and Hillary Clinton was a part of this, by the way, who has made political decisions for our men and women in uniform. I want the men and women at home to know, if I'm commander-in-chief, I will only send you into harm's way when our national security is at risk. And if we do, you know you'll have our full support, the support of the American people, and you'll have a clear path for victory. [applause]\\n\\n ... a lot of those people, though, and I'm going to echo what Senator Rubio just said. This is an issue where, we're talking about my state, it's thousands of manufacturing jobs. Thousands of manufacturing jobs for a rule the Obama administration, own EPA has said will have a marginal impact on climate change.\\n\\nSo we're going to put thousands and thousands of jobs in my state, I think it's something like 30,000 in Ohio, other states across this country, we're going to put people \\u2014 manufacturing jobs, the kind of jobs that are far greater than minimum wage, this administration is willing to put at risk for something its own EPA says is marginal (ph)...\\n\\n First of all, I got to say to Carson, Huckabee, thanks a lot for making the rest of us look like chumps up here, but, I'd pick Clara Barton. I once worked for the American Red Cross, she was a great founder of the Red Cross.\\n\\n Harley. I love riding Harley's.\\n\\n Well, I turned 13 years old two days before Ronald Reagan was first elected. A lot of people forget this, but just a few days before that election 1980, he was behind in the polls.\\n\\nAnd I think what changed things was people in America realized they didn't want to hear what was bad about America, they wanted to know how it was going to be better. Ronald Reagan wasn't just a conservative Republican, he was an eternal optimist in the American people.\\n\\nAnd I am too. So here's what I think will make America better. We need to live in a world where our children are free, are free from the threats of radical Islamic terrorism.\\n\\nWe need to live in an America where we have an economy, where everyone can live their piece of the American dream, no matter what that dream is. And we need to live in an America where we have a federal government that is not too big to fail, but ultimately small enough to succeed, where we send powers back to the states and back to the people.\\n\\nThat's what I did in Wisconsin. We took on the big government union bosses, the big government special interests, many of whom came in from Washington, to spend millions of dollars to try and take me out because we stood up to them, we didn't back down in any of those instances.\\n\\nIf you give me the chance as your next president, I won't back down any day, anyway, anyhow. I'll fight and win for you and your families every single day I'm in office. [applause]\\n\\n\", ...],\n",
       " u'WALLACE': [u' Also of note, Fox News is partnering for tonight\\'s debate with Facebook. For the past several weeks, we\\'ve been asking you for questions for the candidates on Facebook. Nearly 6 million of you, 6 million, viewed the debate videos on our site, and more than 40,000 of you submitted questions: some of which you will hear us asking the candidates tonight.\\n\\n Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. [applause]\\n\\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie. [applause] And your very own governor of Ohio... [applause] ... John Kasich. [applause]\\n\\n Senator Rubio, when Jeb Bush announced his candidacy for presidency, he said this: \"There\\'s no passing off responsibility when you\\'re a governor, no blending into the legislative crowd.\"\\n\\nCould you please address Governor Bush across the stage here, and explain to him why you, someone who has never held executive office, are better prepared to be president than he is, a man who you say did a great job running your state of Florida for eight years.\\n\\n Senator Cruz, your colleague, Senator Paul, right there next to you, said a few months ago he agrees with you on a number of issues, but he says you do nothing to grow the party. He says you feed red meat to the base, but you don\\'t reach out to minorities. You have a toxic relationship with GOP leaders in Congress. You even called the Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell a liar recently. [applause]\\n\\nHow can you win in 2016 when you\\'re such a divisive figure?\\n\\n Governor Huckabee, like Governor Walker, you have staked out strong positions on social issues. You favor a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage. You favor a constitutional amendment banning abortions, except for the life of the mother. Millions of people in this country agree with you, but according to the polls, and again this an electability question, according to the polls, more people don\\'t, so how do you persuade enough Independents and Democrats to get elected in 2016?\\n\\n Gentlemen, we\\'re turning to a new subject that all of you have been talking about and some of you have been disagreeing about, and that is the issue of immigration.\\n\\nGovernor Bush, you released a new plan this week on illegal immigration focusing on enforcement, which some suggest is your effort to show that you\\'re not soft on that issue.\\n\\nI want to ask you about a statement that you made last year about illegal immigrants. And here\\'s what you said. \"They broke the law, but it\\'s not a felony, it\\'s an act of love. It\\'s an act of commitment to your family.\"\\n\\nDo you stand by that statement and do you stand by your support for earned legal status?\\n\\n Thank you, sir. [applause] Mr. Trump, it has not escaped anybody\\'s notice that you say that the Mexican government, the Mexican government is sending criminals -- rapists, drug dealers, across the border.\\n\\nGovernor Bush has called those remarks, quote, \"extraordinarily ugly.\"\\n\\nI\\'d like you -- you\\'re right next to him -- tell us -- talk to him directly and say how you respond to that and -- and you have repeatedly said that you have evidence that the Mexican government is doing this, but you have evidence you have refused or declined to share.\\n\\nWhy not use this first Republican presidential debate to share your proof with the American people?\\n\\n Mr. Trump, I\\'ll give you 30 seconds -- I\\'ll give you 30 seconds to answer my question, which was, what evidence do you have, specific evidence that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border? Thirty seconds.\\n\\n All right. Obviously there\\'s a lot more to talk about this. We\\'re going to have more questions for the candidates on illegal immigration, plus other key topics including your questions on Facebook.\\n\\n[video clip begins]\\n\\n Welcome back to FOX News/Facebook Republican Debate Night. We\\'re going to continue the questions now on illegal immigration. We kind of ended with a cliffhanger there. So let\\'s continue the conversation.\\n\\nGovernor Kasich, I know you don\\'t like to talk about Donald Trump. But I do want to ask you about the merit of what he just said. When you say that the American government is stupid, that the Mexican government is sending criminals, that we\\'re being bamboozled, is that an adequate response to the question of illegal immigration?\\n\\n Respectfully, can we talk about illegal immigration?\\n\\n All right, well, Senator Rubio, let me see if I can do better with you. Is it as simple as our leaders are stupid, their leaders are smart, and all of these illegals coming over are criminals?\\n\\n Governor Walker. [applause]\\n\\nGovernor Walker, from 2002 until as recently as 2013, just two years ago, you supported comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship. Now you say that was a quick reaction to something you hadn\\'t really thought about, and that you\\'ve changed your mind. Other than politics, could you explain why in the last two years you\\'ve changed your position on a path to citizenship, and are there other past positions that we shouldn\\'t hold you to?\\n\\n Senator Cruz, some 1,400 people submitted questions on this very hot topic of illegal immigration on Facebook, and a number of them were about the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco, allegedly shot down by an illegal. Doug Bettencourt sent this question, \"will you support Kate Steinle\\'s Law,\" which would impose a mandatory five-year prison term for an illegal who is deported and then returns to this country? \"And will you defund sanctuary cities for violating federal law?\"\\n\\n Gentlemen, we\\'re obviously digging into some subjects in depth, but we\\'re also going to change it up every once in a while throughout the next hour and have many rounds where we ask, you are not going to like it, only a couple of candidates questions on those subjects. This is the first of the many rounds, and it\\'s about somebody whose name probably hasn\\'t been mentioned enough so far tonight.\\n\\nGovernor Kasich, let me start with you. Whoever the Republican nominee -- [applause]\\n\\nWhoever the Republican nominee is, it looks at least for now like whoever that nominee is, he or she, will be facing off against Hillary Clinton. You know how she will come after whoever the Republican nominee is. She will say that you, whoever it is, support the rich while she supports the middle class. That you want to suppress the rights of women and minorities. She wants to move the country forward while you, the Republicans, want to take the country back to the past.\\n\\nHow will you, if you\\'re the nominee, how will you answer that and take Hillary Clinton on?\\n\\n I know that all of you would like to answer this question, but we\\'re only going to ask one other candidate before we move on to a different subject, Dr. Carson.\\n\\nBasically, same question to you. If Hillary Clinton is the nominee and she comes at you with that kind of line of attack, how will you take Iraq?\\n\\n Gentlemen, we\\'re going to turn now to the subject of the economy, jobs and money and the government. And Governor Bush, I\\'m going to start with you.\\n\\nYou have made a bold promise in your announcement. You have promised four percent economic growth and 19 million new jobs if you are fortunate enough to serve two terms as president.\\n\\nThat many jobs, 19 million, would be triple what your father and your brother accomplished together. And four percent growth, the last president to average that was Lyndon Johnson during the height of the Vietnam War. So question, how on Earth specifically would you pull that off?\\n\\n Governor Walker. [applause] Governor Walker, when you ran for governor of Wisconsin back in 2010, you promised that you would create 250,000 jobs in your first term, first four years. In fact, Wisconsin added barely half that and ranked 35th in the country in job growth. Now you\\'re running for president, and you\\'re promising an economic plan in which everyone will earn a piece of the American dream.\\n\\nGiven your record in Wisconsin, why should voters believe you?\\n\\n Governor Christie, I want to engage you and Governor Huckabee in a subject that is a big issue in both of your campaigns, and that is entitlement reform.\\n\\nYou say that you -- to save the system that you want to raise the retirement age -- have to raise the retirement age, and to cut benefits for Social Security and Medicare, and you say that some of the candidates here on the stage are lying.\\n\\nGovernor Huckabee says he can save Social Security and Medicare without doing any of that. Is he lying?\\n\\n Governor Huckabee?\\n\\nYou say that changing entitlements, the kind of thing that Governor Christie is talking about, would be breaking a promise to the American people, and you say that you can keep those programs, save Social Security, save Medicare, without those kinds of reforms through a FairTax, which is a broad tax on consumption. Please explain to Governor Christie how that would work, and how you could save these programs without the kind of painful reforms he says we need?\\n\\n ...Thirty seconds.\\n\\n ...Alright, this is it. Thirty Seconds, finally.\\n\\n All right. Enough. [applause]\\n\\nMr. Trump.\\n\\n Mr. Trump, you talk a lot about how you are the person on this stage to grow the economy, I want to ask you about your business records. From corporations, Trump corporations, casinos and hotels, have declared bankruptcy four times over the last quarter-century.\\n\\n No, but the concept sir...\\n\\n ... that\\'s your line, but your companies have gone bankrupt.\\n\\n Well sir, let\\'s just talk about the latest example...[applause]...which is Trump Entertainment Resorts, which went bankrupt in 2009. In that case alone, lenders to your company lost over $1 billion and more than 1,100 people were laid off.\\n\\n Is that the way that you\\'d run the country?\\n\\n So...\\n\\n Senator Rubio. Senator Rubio, more than 3,000 people sent us questions about the economy and jobs on Facebook. And here is a video question from Tania Cioloko from Philadelphia. Here she is.[begin video clip]\\n\\n Senator, how do you answer Tania?\\n\\n Senator Rubio, thank you. [applause]\\n\\n Senator Paul, closing statement.\\n\\n Dr. Carson, closing statement.\\n\\n Governor Bush, closing statement, sir.\\n\\n', u'', ...]}"
