Candidate Classifier

This is a small personal project to showcase some of what I've learned about Natural Language processing and web-app design.

The debate transcriptions were taken from The American Presidency Project: `http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu`.

The NgramModel class is resurrected from the NLTK project and is mostly functional but still needs some work.
